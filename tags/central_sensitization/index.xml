It is a pathophysiological process in which the central nervous system undergoes changes that alter its processing of pain and other sensory stimuli 2.
When central sensitization occurs, the nervous system goes through a process called wind-up and gets regulated in a persistent state of high reactivity 1.</description></item></channel></rss>
