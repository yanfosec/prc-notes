They feel supremely entitled and harbor callous disregard for others&rsquo; preferences¹.</li><li><strong>Special</strong>: People at this level use gratitude as a temporary escape into virtue so they don&rsquo;t feel so selfish in their hedonistic drive. Gratitude in them is an occasional companion, often contingent on something big and special happening, and generally doesn&rsquo;t translate into prosocial actions¹.</li><li><strong>Daily Plea</strong>: These people are grateful for the small and simple things. They are aware that what they receive is a collective effort of millions. Grateful thoughts visit their mind on most days and translate into occasional actions geared to help the world¹.</li><li><strong>Regular Things - Everything</strong>: People at this level have gratitude as their constant companion. They are content and have a very low threshold for happiness. Their personal needs are small, their thoughts predominantly prosocial. They still wish to acquire, but only so they can give more¹.</li><li><strong>Adversity</strong>: Finally, there are people who are grateful even for adversities. They live in a state of surrender. Every experience to them is a meaningful gift. They have transcended the duality of good and bad¹.</li></ol><p>These levels represent a journey from a state of ingratitude to a state of constant gratitude, even in the face of adversity.

## SUMMARY
A speaker recounts a near-death experience that inspired a year-long project of expressing gratitude to one person daily.
## IDEAS:</p><ul><li>Near-death experiences can profoundly shift one&rsquo;s perspective on life and relationships.</li><li>Expressing gratitude can strengthen and deepen personal relationships.</li><li>A simple &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; can have a significant emotional impact on both the giver and receiver.</li><li>People often assume others know they are appreciated without verbalizing it.</li><li>Daily gratitude practice can become a natural and integral part of life.</li><li>Reflecting on relationships during critical moments can reveal unspoken appreciations.</li><li>Social media can inspire but also limit the depth of expressing gratitude.</li><li>Personal projects can start from simple ideas and grow into life-changing practices.</li><li>Gratitude can be expressed to anyone, from close friends to casual acquaintances.</li><li>Voicing appreciation can be more challenging than other personal revelations.</li><li>Gratitude can unlock deeper, more meaningful connections with loved ones.</li><li>Publicly sharing gratitude can inspire others to adopt similar practices.</li><li>Gratitude should not be confined to special occasions but practiced daily.</li><li>Unexpected expressions of gratitude can profoundly affect the recipient.</li><li>Reflecting on past interactions can reveal unnoticed influences on personal growth.</li><li>Gratitude can transform one&rsquo;s outlook on daily life and interactions.</li><li>Simple acts of appreciation can have lasting impacts on relationships.</li><li>Personal growth often involves recognizing and appreciating the influence of others.</li><li>Gratitude can be a powerful tool for personal and communal transformation.</li><li>Expressing gratitude requires vulnerability and courage but yields significant rewards.</li><li>Daily gratitude practice encourages looking for the good in every situation.</li><li>Gratitude can bridge gaps in relationships and foster understanding.</li><li>The act of thanking someone can lead to unexpected, meaningful conversations.</li><li>Gratitude projects can inspire community-wide changes in behavior and attitudes.</li><li>Expressing gratitude helps in acknowledging the positive aspects of life.
## INSIGHTS:</li><li>Near-death experiences often catalyze profound personal transformations and reflections on relationships.</li><li>Regularly expressing gratitude can significantly enhance personal happiness and relationship quality.</li><li>People often underestimate the power of verbalizing appreciation in strengthening bonds.</li><li>Simple, consistent acts of gratitude can lead to deeper, more meaningful connections with others.</li><li>Public expressions of gratitude can inspire broader cultural shifts towards appreciation and kindness.
## QUOTES:</li><li>&ldquo;I was so close to dying that day and I was only 18 years old.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Why on earth does this have to just be one day or better yet why only here online?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I was going to try and say thank you to one person every single day with no repeats.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I thanked him for everything I thanked him for the lessons I had learned from him.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t know we appreciate them unless we show it unless we verbalize it.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I wake up every morning and the first thing I think is Who am I going to say thank you to today?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Instead of man this class is going to suck and then I spend the rest of my day looking for the good.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;My 365th thank you is actually to all of you right here in front of me.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s say it let&rsquo;s tell them before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;
## HABITS:</li><li>Reflecting on relationships during critical moments to reveal unspoken appreciations.</li><li>Practicing daily gratitude by thanking one person each day without repeats.</li><li>Writing blog posts about individuals thanked, highlighting their individuality and impact.</li><li>Seeking opportunities throughout the day to express appreciation and look for the good.
## FACTS:</li><li>Near-death experiences can lead to significant shifts in perspective on life and relationships.</li><li>Expressing gratitude regularly can become a natural, integral part of one&rsquo;s daily routine.</li><li>People often assume others know they are appreciated without explicitly saying it.
