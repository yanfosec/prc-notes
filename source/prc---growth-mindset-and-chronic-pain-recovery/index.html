Growth mindset is all about the confidence in evolving and growing with effort
## Definitions</p><p>The difference between a <strong>growth mindset</strong> and a <strong>fixed mindset</strong> in the context of child development and parenting.</p><ol><li><p><strong>Fixed Mindset</strong>: This mindset is based on the belief that a person&rsquo;s abilities, intelligence, and talents are fixed traits that cannot be significantly changed or developed. Children with a fixed mindset may avoid challenges because they fear failure, and they may give up easily when they encounter obstacles. They often view criticism as a personal attack and feel threatened by the success of others. In a fixed mindset, the focus is on proving oneself rather than improving oneself.</p></li><li><p><strong>Growth Mindset</strong>: This mindset, on the other hand, is based on the belief that a person&rsquo;s abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, hard work, and the right kind of guidance. Children with a growth mindset embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see effort as a path to mastery, learn from criticism, and find lessons and inspiration in the success of others. They believe they can get smarter or more talented if they work hard and persevere.</p></li></ol><p>As a behavioral child therapist, it&rsquo;s important to encourage a growth mindset in children. This can be done by praising effort rather than innate ability, teaching children that it&rsquo;s okay to make mistakes and that they can learn from them, and promoting the idea that abilities and intelligence can be developed. A growth mindset can help children become more resilient, persistent, and motivated to learn. It can also contribute to their overall well-being and success in life.</p><p>Remember, the goal is not to completely eliminate the fixed mindset, but to promote a balance where the child understands that while some things may come more naturally to them, they can still grow and improve in other areas through effort and perseverance. It&rsquo;s about teaching them that they have the capacity to learn, grow, and overcome challenges, which is a powerful lesson that will serve them well throughout their lives.</p><h2 id=examples>Examples
<a class=anchor href=#examples>#</a></h2><p>Here are some examples of <strong>fixed</strong> and <strong>growth</strong> mindsets:</p><p><strong>Fixed Mindset Examples:</strong></p><ol><li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just not good at math.&rdquo; This statement implies that the ability to do math is an innate talent that can&rsquo;t be changed.</li><li>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t draw. I&rsquo;m not an artist.&rdquo; This suggests that artistic ability is a fixed trait, and if you don&rsquo;t have it, you can&rsquo;t develop it.</li><li>&ldquo;I tried playing the guitar once, but I was terrible. I&rsquo;m just not musical.&rdquo; This indicates a belief that musical ability is something you either have or you don&rsquo;t.</li></ol><p><strong>Growth Mindset Examples:</strong></p><ol><li>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do well on this test, but I&rsquo;ll study harder for the next one.&rdquo; This shows a belief that performance can be improved with effort.</li><li>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a great writer yet, but I can become one if I keep practicing and learning.&rdquo; This demonstrates a belief in the ability to develop new skills over time.</li><li>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do this&mldr;yet.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;yet&rdquo; is powerful in a growth mindset, indicating a belief in the potential for change and improvement.</li></ol><p>Remember, the key difference between the two mindsets is the belief about whether abilities and talents can be developed (growth mindset) or are fixed traits (fixed mindset). Encouraging a growth mindset can help children see challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as insurmountable obstacles. It&rsquo;s about the journey of learning, not just the destination.</p><h1 id=carol-dweck---a-study-on-praise-and-mindsets>Carol Dweck - A Study on Praise and Mindsets

## SUMMARY
Carol D and colleagues studied the impact of praise on children&rsquo;s development, revealing significant differences between praising intelligence and effort.
## IDEAS:</p><ul><li>Carol D&rsquo;s study involved over 400 fifth-grade students from across the nation.</li><li>Children were given a simple nonverbal IQ test with 10 questions.</li><li>Two groups were formed: one praised for intelligence, the other for effort.</li><li>Praising intelligence led 67% of children to choose an easier subsequent test.</li><li>Praising effort led 92% of children to choose a harder subsequent test.</li><li>Praising intelligence can lead to a fixed mindset, limiting growth.</li><li>Praising effort encourages a growth mindset, promoting learning and resilience.</li><li>Children praised for effort worked harder and enjoyed difficult tasks more.</li><li>Children praised for intelligence got frustrated and gave up more easily.</li><li>Final test results showed a 50% performance difference between the two groups.</li><li>Intelligence-praised group&rsquo;s scores dropped by 20% on the final test.</li><li>Effort-praised group&rsquo;s scores increased by nearly 30% on the final test.</li><li>Subtle differences in praise can significantly impact a child&rsquo;s development.</li><li>Teachers, coaches, and parents should focus on praising effort over intelligence.</li><li>Growth mindset positively impacts development in various life areas.</li><li>Praising strategies and hard work fosters long-term growth and resilience.</li><li>Fixed mindset leads to playing it safe and avoiding challenges.</li><li>Growth mindset encourages taking on hard tasks and intense practice.</li><li>Mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth in a growth mindset.</li><li>Research shows growth mindset has a big impact on child development.
## INSIGHTS</li><li>Subtle differences in praise can significantly impact children&rsquo;s development and mindset.</li><li>Praising effort encourages children to embrace challenges and develop resilience.</li><li>Fixed mindsets limit growth by making children avoid risks and challenges.</li><li>Growth mindsets foster long-term development by valuing effort and learning.</li><li>Children praised for effort enjoy difficult tasks more than those praised for intelligence.</li><li>Intelligence-praised children tend to give up more easily when faced with challenges.</li><li>Effort-praised children show significant improvement in performance over time.</li><li>Teachers and parents should focus on praising the process, not innate abilities.</li><li>Growth mindset positively affects performance in academics, sports, and life.</li><li>Mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities in a growth mindset.
## QUOTES:</li><li>&ldquo;Wow great job you must be really smart at this.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Wow great job you must have worked really really hard at this.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;67% of them chose the easier option while 92% of the kids who were praised for their effort chose the harder test.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;They enter a fixed mindset, they play it safe in the future and they limit their growth.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the process of growth.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t take on hard things and stick to them, I&rsquo;m not going to grow.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;The group that was praised for effort worked hard harder longer and actually enjoyed this test more.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;The group that was praised for their intelligence actually did worse on this test than the first one.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Their average score actually dropped by 20% while the group that was praised for their effort did significantly better raising their average score by nearly 30%.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;This study shows how praise can either make or break a child&rsquo;s development.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;We need to be very careful about praising someone&rsquo;s intelligence or abilities and focus more on the process and the effort that they put forth.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Having a growth mindset has a big time impact on the development of a child whether on the court in the classroom or just in life.&rdquo;
## HABITS</li><li>Focus on praising children&rsquo;s effort rather than their intelligence.</li><li>Encourage children to take on challenging tasks to promote growth.</li><li>Emphasize the importance of hard work and perseverance in learning.</li><li>View mistakes as opportunities for growth and learning.</li><li>Foster a growth mindset by valuing the process over innate abilities.
## FACTS</li><li>Over 400 fifth-grade students participated in Carol D&rsquo;s study on praise.</li><li>Praising intelligence led 67% of children to choose an easier subsequent test.</li><li>Praising effort led 92% of children to choose a harder subsequent test.</li><li>Intelligence-praised children&rsquo;s scores dropped by 20% on a final test.</li><li>Effort-praised children&rsquo;s scores increased by nearly 30% on a final test.

## SUMMARY
Carol Dweck discusses the concept of &ldquo;Not Yet&rdquo; and its impact on fostering a growth mindset in students, emphasizing resilience and continuous improvement.

## INSIGHTS</li><li>&ldquo;Not Yet&rdquo; grades shift focus from failure to potential future success, fostering resilience.</li><li>Growth mindsets transform challenges into opportunities for development and learning.</li><li>Fixed mindsets lead to avoidance of challenges and reliance on external validation.</li><li>Praising the process rather than innate talent builds resilience and perseverance in children.</li><li>Growth mindset students actively engage with errors, leading to deeper learning and correction.</li><li>Environments fostering growth mindsets are essential for equitable education and human rights.</li><li>Teaching about brain plasticity through effort can significantly improve student performance.</li><li>Growth mindset principles can close achievement gaps in underperforming student groups.</li><li>Effort and difficulty are redefined as opportunities for growth in growth mindset environments.</li><li>Applying growth mindset principles can lead to improvements in various life areas.
## QUOTES:</li><li>&ldquo;The power of yet.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;If you get a failing grade, you think, I&rsquo;m nothing, I&rsquo;m nowhere.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;They understood that their abilities could be developed.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;They were gripped in the tyranny of now.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Their brain is on fire with yet.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting A&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Employers are coming to me and saying, we have already raised a generation of young workers who can&rsquo;t get through the day without an award.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Praising the process that kids engage in: their effort, their strategies, their focus, their perseverance, their improvement.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;This process praise creates kids who are hardy and resilient.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Just the words &lsquo;yet&rsquo; or &rsquo;not yet,&rsquo; we&rsquo;re finding, give kids greater confidence.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Every time they push out of their comfort zone to learn something new and difficult, the neurons in their brain can form new, stronger connections.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;In one year, a kindergarten class in Harlem, New York scored in the 95th percentile on the National Achievement Test.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;The native kids outdid the Microsoft kids.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;Effort and difficulty made them feel dumb, made them feel like giving up.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;I now realize I&rsquo;ve wasted most of my life.&rdquo;</li><li>&ldquo;It becomes a basic human right for children, all children, to live in places that create that growth.&rdquo;
## HABITS</li><li>Praise children&rsquo;s effort, strategies, focus, perseverance, and improvement rather than innate intelligence or talent.</li><li>Encourage children to view challenges as opportunities for development and learning.</li><li>Teach children about brain plasticity and how effort strengthens neural connections.</li><li>Create environments that foster growth mindsets to promote equitable education.</li><li>Use the concept of &ldquo;Not Yet&rdquo; to provide a path into the future and encourage persistence.
