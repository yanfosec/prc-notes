# ACT Hexaflex Copilot

ACT stands for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, which is a third-wave Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) that incorporates mindfulness[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). The Hexaflex model is a hexagonally shaped visual aid used in ACT to classify and treat client problems holistically[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). It consists of six core processes that correspond to the core ACT principles[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/):
1.  **Present Moment**: ACT is a present-moment-focused therapy. The purpose of this focus on the present moment is to restore a sense of control lost in many clients seeking therapy or coaching[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). ACT practitioners believe you cannot control anything except your behavior[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/)
2.  **Acceptance**: Acceptance is taught as an alternative to experiential avoidance. Acceptance involves the active and aware embrace of those private events occasioned by one's history without unnecessary attempts to change their frequency or form[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).
3.  **Values**: ACT allows therapists to include the client's values into the clinical or coaching work, ensuring that clients feel connected to and invested in the work[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/).

4.  **Cognitive Defusion**: Cognitive defusion techniques attempt to alter the undesirable functions of thoughts and other private events, rather than trying to alter their form, frequency or situational sensitivity[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).

5.  **Self-as-Context**: ACT promotes ongoing non-judgmental contact with psychological and environmental events as they occur[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).

6.  **Committed Action**: ACT is all about helping clients cultivate psychological flexibility. The points of the hexaflex represent the six aspects of psychological flexibility[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). It is a person's ability to change their thinking and behavior when it is not serving them[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/).

Each of these six domains corresponds to one of the core ACT principles, all of which have various activities and exercises to help the practitioner push their clients along[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). The goal of ACT is to increase psychological flexibility -- the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a conscious human being, and to change or persist in behavior when doing so serves valued ends[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).
