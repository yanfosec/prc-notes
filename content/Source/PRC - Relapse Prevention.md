# PRC is NOT

Not about doing something once

# PRC IS

Continuing to do things even when not 100%

# Key Concepts

**New Mindset**

Asking the question: **What can I do to manage this?**

Especially useful for new symptoms

# Difficult Day vs Lapse vs Relapse

- **Difficult Day** - High symptoms/stress but still using PRC concepts
- **Lapse** - brief return to old habits in a moment of symptoms/stress, return to habits in one behavior
- **Relapse** - prolonged return to old habits in many behaviors, decreased functioning, may need more intense intervention

> \[!WARNING\] Relapse
> Relapse is a process, not an event!

# Potential triggers for lapse/relapse

## Adolescent triggers and cues?

- Friend drama
- Family stressors
- Reminder of something stressful
- Acute Illness - New symptoms
- Trips / Vacations
- Summer - Less structure
- Friends / Sleepovers
- Rooms where pain was comforted (Bedroom, couch, etc.)
  \## Parent triggers and cues?
- Flare / Increased or New Symptoms
- Siblings
- New Injury/Illness
- New activities / sports
- Busy
- Not busy enough

# CBT Triangle

Can be used to help prevent relapse
\## Example - bad
- Notice a lapse: "I screwed up. I'll never be able to do this"
- Guilt, anxiety, tension leading to more symptoms
- Withdrawal, isolation
\## Example - good
- Notice a lapse: "what can I learn from this?"
- Calm Confidence
- Choose & complete a PRC skill

# Key Concept

- When people relapse, they often feel guilty about what they did, didn't do, could have done, should have done
- Instead, focus on "What can I do now?"

# Feedback from Relapse-Free Grads

- Daily structure - Even on weekends
- Keep up with your daily relaxation techniques
- Do your daily aerobics, exercise
- Keep in touch with other PRC Patients
- See your counselor weekly
- Practice good sleep hygiene

# Common reasons for setbacks from PRC Grads

- Overloading school schedule
- New symptoms lead to further medical workup
- Not working with a counselor
- Believing I will not get better

> \[!INFO\] Word to the Wise
> Feeling better can be a relapse warning sign... over-confidence

# PRC Relapse Prevention Model

1.  Wellness is a marathon, not a sprint
2.  I am human
3.  Any relapse is a learning opportunity
4.  What can **I** do **now**?

# What can I do now?
