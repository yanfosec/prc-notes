Anxiety disorder is a mental health condition characterized by excessive and persistent worry, fear, and anxiety that interfere with daily activities[1](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/1200/anxiety-disorders-children-adolescents.html). It's the most common mental health disorder in the United States, affecting about 8% of children and teenagers[2](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-and-stress-in-teens).

Anxiety disorders in adolescents include specific phobias, social anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, panic disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder[1](https://www.aafp.org/pubs/afp/issues/2022/1200/anxiety-disorders-children-adolescents.html). Symptoms generally include excessive fears and worries, feelings of inner restlessness, and a tendency to be excessively wary and vigilant[3](https://www.aacap.org/aacap/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/Anxiety_Disorder_Resource_Center/Your_Adolescent_Anxiety_and_Avoidant_Disorders.aspx). Physical symptoms such as sleep problems, muscle tension, headaches, stomachaches, and pain can also occur[3](https://www.aacap.org/aacap/Families_and_Youth/Resource_Centers/Anxiety_Disorder_Resource_Center/Your_Adolescent_Anxiety_and_Avoidant_Disorders.aspx).

Supporting an adolescent with an anxiety disorder involves understanding their condition, providing emotional support, and encouraging healthy habits[4](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201911/anxiety-in-teens-how-you-can-help)[5](https://www.relate.org.uk/get-help/how-support-teenager-who-experiencing-anxiety). Here are some strategies:

1.  **Create a Safe Space**: Make sure your teenager feels comfortable and safe before starting the conversation[4](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201911/anxiety-in-teens-how-you-can-help).
2.  **Validate Their Feelings**: Let your teenager know that you understand their anxiety and that it's a real and valid feeling[4](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201911/anxiety-in-teens-how-you-can-help).
3.  **Encourage Them to Talk**: Encourage your teenager to express their feelings and concerns[4](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201911/anxiety-in-teens-how-you-can-help).
4.  **Offer Support**: Be there for your teenager, offering comfort and reassurance[4](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201911/anxiety-in-teens-how-you-can-help).
5.  **Encourage Healthy Habits**: Encourage a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and good sleep habits[2](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/anxiety-disorders/anxiety-and-stress-in-teens).
6.  **Help Them Develop Coping Strategies**: Help your teenager learn and practice relaxation techniques and stress management strategies[5](https://www.relate.org.uk/get-help/how-support-teenager-who-experiencing-anxiety).
7.  **Seek Professional Help**: If your teenager's anxiety is severe or persists despite your efforts, it may be helpful to seek professional help[5](https://www.relate.org.uk/get-help/how-support-teenager-who-experiencing-anxiety).

Here are some published works on anxiety disorders in adolescents:

Remember, every teenager is unique, and what works for one might not work for another. It's important to be patient, understanding, and supportive[4](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-moment-youth/201911/anxiety-in-teens-how-you-can-help).
