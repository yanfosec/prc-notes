A prescribing cascade is a sequence of events where an adverse drug event is misinterpreted as a new medical condition, leading to the prescription of an additional, potentially avoidable, medication[1](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m261)[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215). This process can lead to further side effects and unanticipated drug interactions, which may result in further symptoms and misdiagnoses[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_cascade).

For example, a patient might be prescribed a calcium channel blocker, which can cause ankle edema. If this side effect is misinterpreted as a new medical condition, a diuretic might be prescribed to treat the edema[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215). In another example, a patient develops a cough after starting an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. A cough syrup with guafenasin and codeine is prescribed, leading to lethargy. Levofloxacin is started for presumed pneumonia, which leads to diarrhea, followed by delirium and admission to hospital[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215).

Prescribing cascades contribute to inappropriate polypharmacy, particularly in older adults[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215). Patients with chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes that require complex drug regimens are at increased risk for problematic and inappropriate polypharmacy[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215).

To prevent prescribing cascades, healthcare providers should ask themselves if a patient's new symptom could be an adverse drug event from a medication they are already taking. If so, they should consider whether the initial drug could be substituted for a safer alternative or if the dose could be reduced, potentially eliminating the need for the subsequent drug therapy[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215). Deprescribing, or the process of tapering or stopping drugs that may not be indicated, can also be considered when a cascade is identified[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215).
