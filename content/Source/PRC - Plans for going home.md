# Rules

- Need to figure out which strategies apply to who in the house?
- Chores should apply to all kids
- Rules like napping should apply to all
- Adults napping is OK, as long as it's kept away from the kids and no bragging
- Figure out what to share and who to share it with, so limit or minimize questions about health.
- Steve & Ksusha? Igor and Natasha?

> \[!NOTE\] With well-wishers
> **Don't talk about symptoms**

# Considerations

## Primary Care Doc

It would be useful to get in touch to make sure they are there if something comes up. With Southlake Pediatrics, I am not sure.\*

Do we need to find an actual primary doctor?

**They don't need specialists, but FND is OK**

## Counselor - Weekly

*(6 months - 1 year)*

Even if Guenn doesn't think it's necessary, still needs to see one. Focus on accountability and making sure Guenn doesn't fall off track. Perhaps Dr. Jade can do that?

Can slide to every other week if Guenn is doing well, following the advice of the counselor

**Dr. Jade sounds like a perfect fit for this role**.

### Things to discuss with a therapist

- Exposure Therapy for Anxiety
- Behavioral Activation (Making plans, goals, etc.)
  \## Back to school in person

We need to factor in summer plans before school starts.\*

- Be out of the house 9-3 or 9-4 with other people.
- It may be reasonable to keep accelerated math.
- 1-2 extracurricular activity
- May want to move away from the 504 plan
- **Headphones are a bad idea. It's a pain behavior** --\> Almost exposure therapy to not have them on

> \[!IDEA\]
> ***The fewest accommodations possible***

### Supported Accommodations

- Water Bottles
- Bathroom Access (during class time)
- Access to a quiet place on a difficult day for 10-20 minutes (*Not nurse's office*)
- Access to snacks

***Summer camps are fine, even if overnight***
\## Difficult Day Plan
- Ways to Recognize Effort in overcoming difficult days

# Chores

Focus on something for the family for at least 2
1 should be making the bed

> \[!NOTE\]
> Need to clearly define the difference between taking care of yourself, like packing lunch, and doing chores that actually benefit multiple people.
