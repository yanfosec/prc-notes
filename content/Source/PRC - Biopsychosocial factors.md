refer to the interconnection between biology, psychology, and socio-environmental factors. These factors play a significant role in understanding health and wellness[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). Here's a breakdown of each component:

1.  **Biological Factors**: These include physiological factors such as genetics and illness pathology[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). Our physical well-being impacts our mental health for multiple reasons. For example, chronic pain can lead to symptoms of depression[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226).

2.  **Psychological Factors**: This involves thoughts, emotions, and behavior[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). Mental health is health, and one's psychological well-being impacts both mental and physical health[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226).

3.  **Social Factors**: These encompass socioeconomic components, social support, and culture[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). Social factors can significantly influence both our physical and mental health[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226).

The biopsychosocial model, which incorporates these factors, was developed by Dr. George Engel and Dr. John Romano in the 1970s[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). This model is now widely used in healthcare and has become an alternative to the biomedical and/or psychological dominance of many health care systems[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model). It provides a more holistic understanding of a patient's health by considering the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model).
