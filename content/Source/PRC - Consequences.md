# Consequences Overview

- It's much more difficult to force consequences than rewards, especially with kids with chronic illnesses.

- Overdoing rewards will not help in the long run.

- Once you reward positives, that becomes the only reason. Once rewards are taken away, a person can fall back hard...

- Celebrating "first time" events are fine, but limited usefulness

- Consequences are good for learning things quickly

- Consequences should not be a surprise

- Inconsistency in applying consequences can be stressful in its own right

- Depression should not interfere with applying consequences

- Consequences are only for 24 hours

- It's better to have consequences that require Guenn to voluntarily comply over those where they can be enforced externally
