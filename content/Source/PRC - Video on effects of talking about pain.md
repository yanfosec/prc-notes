\# ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:
Stanford University researcher Sean Mackey found a way for people to use their brain to control pain.

# MAIN POINTS:

1.  Debra considers decorations indoors due to back pain limiting outdoor activities.
2.  Sean Mackey's experiment taught people to control their brain's pain perception.
3.  The experiment focused on the cingulate cortex, a part of the brain perceiving pain.
4.  MRI scanner allowed real-time observation of brain activity related to pain perception.
5.  Focusing on pain increased brain activity, while shifting attention decreased it.
6.  Patients learned to control their brains and reduce pain over time.
7.  Control over the brain's pain center improved with learning.
8.  Long-term effectiveness of brain control over pain is still unknown.
9.  Mackey's tests show hope in the brain's ability to manage pain effectively.

# TAKEAWAYS:

1.  Brain control can help manage pain perception effectively.
2.  Real-time observation of brain activity aids in understanding pain management.
3.  Learning to control the brain can lead to reduced pain over time.
4.  Mackey's research offers hope for improving pain management techniques.
5.  Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of brain control over pain.
