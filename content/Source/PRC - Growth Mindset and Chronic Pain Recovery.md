# Growth Mindset and Chronic Pain Recovery

Fixed mindset is all about accepting limitations
Growth mindset is all about the confidence in evolving and growing with effort
\## Definitions

The difference between a **growth mindset** and a **fixed mindset** in the context of child development and parenting.

1.  **Fixed Mindset**: This mindset is based on the belief that a person's abilities, intelligence, and talents are fixed traits that cannot be significantly changed or developed. Children with a fixed mindset may avoid challenges because they fear failure, and they may give up easily when they encounter obstacles. They often view criticism as a personal attack and feel threatened by the success of others. In a fixed mindset, the focus is on proving oneself rather than improving oneself.

2.  **Growth Mindset**: This mindset, on the other hand, is based on the belief that a person's abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, hard work, and the right kind of guidance. Children with a growth mindset embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see effort as a path to mastery, learn from criticism, and find lessons and inspiration in the success of others. They believe they can get smarter or more talented if they work hard and persevere.

As a behavioral child therapist, it's important to encourage a growth mindset in children. This can be done by praising effort rather than innate ability, teaching children that it's okay to make mistakes and that they can learn from them, and promoting the idea that abilities and intelligence can be developed. A growth mindset can help children become more resilient, persistent, and motivated to learn. It can also contribute to their overall well-being and success in life.

Remember, the goal is not to completely eliminate the fixed mindset, but to promote a balance where the child understands that while some things may come more naturally to them, they can still grow and improve in other areas through effort and perseverance. It's about teaching them that they have the capacity to learn, grow, and overcome challenges, which is a powerful lesson that will serve them well throughout their lives.

## Examples

Here are some examples of **fixed** and **growth** mindsets:

**Fixed Mindset Examples:**
1. "I'm just not good at math." This statement implies that the ability to do math is an innate talent that can't be changed.
2. "I can't draw. I'm not an artist." This suggests that artistic ability is a fixed trait, and if you don't have it, you can't develop it.
3. "I tried playing the guitar once, but I was terrible. I'm just not musical." This indicates a belief that musical ability is something you either have or you don't.

**Growth Mindset Examples:**
1. "I didn't do well on this test, but I'll study harder for the next one." This shows a belief that performance can be improved with effort.
2. "I'm not a great writer yet, but I can become one if I keep practicing and learning." This demonstrates a belief in the ability to develop new skills over time.
3. "I can't do this...yet." The word "yet" is powerful in a growth mindset, indicating a belief in the potential for change and improvement.

Remember, the key difference between the two mindsets is the belief about whether abilities and talents can be developed (growth mindset) or are fixed traits (fixed mindset). Encouraging a growth mindset can help children see challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as insurmountable obstacles. It's about the journey of learning, not just the destination.
