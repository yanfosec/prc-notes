# Sympathetic vs. Parasympathetic

The **sympathetic** and **parasympathetic** nervous systems are both components of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which regulates the involuntary and reflexive functions of the human body[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).

Here are the key differences between the two:

1.  **Origin**: The sympathetic nervous system originates in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, while the parasympathetic nervous system originates in the sacral region of the spinal cord and the medulla[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
2.  **Key Function**: The sympathetic nervous system controls the body's response to perceived threats (fight or flight), while the parasympathetic nervous system regulates the body's functions at rest (rest and digest[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
3.  **Effect on Heart Rate**: The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate, while the parasympathetic nervous system decreases heart rate[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
4.  **Effect on Lungs**: The sympathetic nervous system causes bronchial tubes to dilate, while the parasympathetic nervous system causes bronchial tubes to contract[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
5.  **Effect on Muscles**: The sympathetic nervous system causes muscles to contract, while the parasympathetic nervous system causes muscles to relax[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
6.  **Effect on Pupils**: The sympathetic nervous system causes pupils to dilate, while the parasympathetic nervous system causes pupils to constrict[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
7.  **Effect on Digestive System**: The sympathetic nervous system decreases digestive function, while the parasympathetic nervous system increases digestive function[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
8.  **Effect on Saliva Production**: The sympathetic nervous system decreases saliva production, while the parasympathetic nervous system increases saliva production[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
9.  **Effect on Mucus Production**: The sympathetic nervous system decreases mucus production, while the parasympathetic nervous system increases mucus production[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
10. **Effect on Urine Secretion**: The sympathetic nervous system decreases urine secretion, while the parasympathetic nervous system increases urine secretion[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
11. **Effect on Glycogen to Glucose Conversion**: The sympathetic nervous system increases the conversion of glycogen to glucose, while the parasympathetic nervous system does not[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).

In summary, the sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for action, while the parasympathetic nervous system helps the body to relax and recover[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/)[2](https://byjus.com/biology/difference-between-sympathetic-and-parasympathetic/).

# Parasympathetic Response Activation

[Diaphragm - 3D Medical Animation \|\| ABP © - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23-KAubf-js)
Activating the parasympathetic response, also known as the "rest and digest" response, can help you manage stress and promote relaxation. Here are some techniques you can try:

1.  **Deep Breathing**: Deep abdominal breathing exercises can quickly relax you because it stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System)[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/)[3](https://healthnews.com/family-health/healthy-living/how-to-activate-the-parasympathetic-nervous-system/). You can try simple "box breathing" where you inhale for four counts, hold your breath at the "top" for four counts, exhale for four counts, hold your breath at the "bottom" for four counts[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System).
2.  **Visualization**: Visualize yourself in a relaxing situation. Pick an image that feels comfortable to you, such as a peaceful beach, a sunny hillside, or a trickling mountain stream[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System).
3.  **Touching Your Lips**: Your lips are connected to parasympathetic fibers, which are stimulated when you touch your lips. Gently slide 1 or 2 fingers over your lips to activate these nerve fibers[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System)[3](https://healthnews.com/family-health/healthy-living/how-to-activate-the-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
4.  **Meditation**: Spend 10 minutes quieting your mind and focusing on your breathing[3](https://healthnews.com/family-health/healthy-living/how-to-activate-the-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).
5.  **Mild Exercise**: Engage in mild exercise like yoga or a nature walk[4](https://www.hss.edu/article_parasympathetic-nervous-system.asp).
6.  **Massage**: Getting a massage can stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/).
7.  **Acupuncture**: This procedure has the ability to stimulate the vagus nerve and other key areas of the nervous system, and to increase the release of acetylcholine[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/).
8.  **Ear Seeds**: Ear seeds are actual or synthetic seeds or similar small objects that are being used to stimulate pressure points in the ear[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/).
9.  **Nature Therapy**: Simply immersing yourself in nature can help the body achieve physiological relaxation[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/).

Remember, these techniques are not meant to solve problems or control emotions, but to calm the body and mind so that problems can be solved more effectively[5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpKpW0EhYo)[6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5CFSmYEU)[7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5WbXDnZ1Wg). If you do these things consistently, you should feel more relaxed. However, you might need to do it several times a day to help you deal with chronic stress[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System).

# How to do it

> \[!NOTE\]
> It's not about deep breathing, but rather about paced breathing

> \[!Goal\] Goal
> 6-8 breaths per minute

1.  **Position**: Begin by lying down on a flat surface with a pillow under your head and pillows beneath your knees for comfort[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing). You can also practice this sitting up straight in a comfortable position once you've mastered the technique[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974).
2.  **Hand Placement**: Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, just below your ribs[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing)[3](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lungs-breathing-and-respiration/diaphragmatic-breathing)[4](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing).
3.  **Inhale**: Breathe in slowly through your nose, drawing the breath down toward your stomach. Your stomach should push upward against your hand, while your chest remains still[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing)[3](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lungs-breathing-and-respiration/diaphragmatic-breathing)[4](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing).
4.  **Exhale**: Tighten your abdominal muscles and let your stomach fall downward while exhaling through pursed lips[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing). Again, the chest should remain still[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing)[3](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lungs-breathing-and-respiration/diaphragmatic-breathing)[4](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing).
5.  **Pace**: Do not over-breathe. Usually, a pace of breathing in to the count of 3, pause, then exhale to the count of 3 is a good place to start[5](https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/adult-pain-medicine/newsfeed-post/diaphragmatic-breathing-why-it-is-the-secret-weapon-against-chronic-pain/).
6.  **Duration**: Practice this breathing exercise for 5--10 minutes at a time, around three to four times each day[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing).

Remember, diaphragmatic breathing is a skill that takes time to learn. Be patient with yourself and practice regularly. Over time, you'll likely find that this type of deep, intentional breathing becomes more natural[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing)[3](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lungs-breathing-and-respiration/diaphragmatic-breathing)[4](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing)[5](https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/adult-pain-medicine/newsfeed-post/diaphragmatic-breathing-why-it-is-the-secret-weapon-against-chronic-pain/).
