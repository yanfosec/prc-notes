Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that's often used to treat anxiety disorders[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu&type=condition&source=bingmainline_conditionqna)[2](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/cbt-for-anxiety). Here's how it works:

1.  **Understanding Thought Patterns**: CBT helps individuals identify and understand their negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu&type=condition&source=bingmainline_conditionqna).
2.  **Changing Thought Patterns**: Once these negative thought patterns are identified, CBT works on changing them[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu&type=condition&source=bingmainline_conditionqna). This is done by challenging these thoughts and helping the individual replace them with more positive or realistic thoughts[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu&type=condition&source=bingmainline_conditionqna).
3.  **Coping Skills**: CBT teaches individuals coping skills to manage their anxiety[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu&type=condition&source=bingmainline_conditionqna). This includes relaxation techniques and gradual exposure to anxiety triggers[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu&type=condition&source=bingmainline_conditionqna).
4.  **Behavioral Techniques**: CBT also involves behavioral techniques, such as exposure therapy, where individuals are gradually exposed to the situations they fear in a safe and controlled manner[2](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/cbt-for-anxiety).
5.  **Effectiveness**: Research suggests that CBT is a highly effective treatment for anxiety-related mental health conditions, including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)[2](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/cbt-for-anxiety). The anxiety-reducing benefits of CBT seem to last at least 12 months[2](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/cbt-for-anxiety).
6.  **Routine Clinical Care**: A systematic review and meta-analysis conducted on CBT for adult anxiety disorders in routine clinical care found large within-group effect sizes for anxiety measures at posttreatment and follow-up[3](https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2023-84176-001.html).

Remember, while CBT can be highly effective, it's not a quick fix. It requires effort and practice. But for many people, it can lead to significant improvement in their anxiety symptoms and quality of life[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu&type=condition&source=bingmainline_conditionqna)[2](https://psychcentral.com/anxiety/cbt-for-anxiety).
