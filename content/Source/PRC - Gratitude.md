# Five depths of gratitude video

[Five Depths of Gratitude - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwPtJ6yjl8E)

1.  **Ungrateful**: At this level, people don't know how to be grateful. They feel supremely entitled and harbor callous disregard for others' preferences¹.
2.  **Special**: People at this level use gratitude as a temporary escape into virtue so they don't feel so selfish in their hedonistic drive. Gratitude in them is an occasional companion, often contingent on something big and special happening, and generally doesn't translate into prosocial actions¹.
3.  **Daily Plea**: These people are grateful for the small and simple things. They are aware that what they receive is a collective effort of millions. Grateful thoughts visit their mind on most days and translate into occasional actions geared to help the world¹.
4.  **Regular Things - Everything**: People at this level have gratitude as their constant companion. They are content and have a very low threshold for happiness. Their personal needs are small, their thoughts predominantly prosocial. They still wish to acquire, but only so they can give more¹.
5.  **Adversity**: Finally, there are people who are grateful even for adversities. They live in a state of surrender. Every experience to them is a meaningful gift. They have transcended the duality of good and bad¹.

These levels represent a journey from a state of ingratitude to a state of constant gratitude, even in the face of adversity. It's a transformative process that can lead to increased resilience and overall well-being¹.
