# Active Listening

- Pause
  - Don't jump in or interrupt
- Practice patience and open mind (BREATHE!)
- Practice Reflective Listening
  - "Is that right? Did I hear you correctly?"

Active listening is a crucial skill that can improve communication and build stronger relationships. Here are some tips to enhance your active listening skills:
1. **Pay Attention**: Give the speaker your undivided attention. Put aside distracting thoughts and avoid being distracted by environmental factors.
2. **Show That You're Listening**: Use your body language to show you're engaged. Nod occasionally, maintain eye contact, and use small verbal comments like "yes" or "uh huh" to show you're involved in the conversation.
3. **Provide Feedback**: Reflect on what's been said by paraphrasing. "What I'm hearing is..." or "It sounds like you're saying..." are great ways to provide feedback.
4. **Defer Judgment**: Allow the speaker to finish their point before you ask questions. Interrupting is a barrier to effective communication.
5. **Respond Appropriately**: Active listening is a model for respect and understanding. Be candid, open, and honest in your response.

# Reflective Listening

Reflective listening is a communication strategy involving two key steps: understanding the speaker and also sharing that understanding back to the speaker. It's a way of "reflecting" the speaker's words and feelings back to them. Here are some examples:

1.  **Paraphrasing**: This involves restating the speaker's words in your own words. For example, if the speaker says, "I'm feeling overwhelmed with my workload," you might say, "It sounds like you have too much on your plate right now."
2.  **Reflecting Feelings**: This involves identifying the speaker's emotions and expressing them back. For example, if the speaker seems upset about a recent argument, you might say, "It seems like that argument really upset you."
3.  **Reflecting Meanings**: This involves understanding the speaker's message and reflecting it back. For example, if the speaker is talking about a difficult decision they made, you might say, "You're wondering if you made the right choice."
4.  **Summarizing**: This involves bringing together the speaker's thoughts and expressing them in a brief statement. For example, after a long conversation, you might say, "So, you're not happy with your job because of the workload, and you're considering other options."
