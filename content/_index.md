# Overview
I was fortunately enough to have been a part of Mayo Clinic's Pediatric Pain Rehabilitation Center (PPRC), and took a lot of notes during all the parent and family sessions.  Since some of the content involved links to videos and is in some way connected, I wanted to publish my notes in this interactive format, for the benefit of other parents and anyone else who may find this information useful.
