The Hexaflex model is a hexagonally shaped visual aid used in ACT to classify and treat client problems holistically[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). It consists of six core processes that correspond to the core ACT principles[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/):\n1.  **Present Moment**: ACT is a present-moment-focused therapy. The purpose of this focus on the present moment is to restore a sense of control lost in many clients seeking therapy or coaching[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). ACT practitioners believe you cannot control anything except your behavior[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/)\n2.  **Acceptance**: Acceptance is taught as an alternative to experiential avoidance. Acceptance involves the active and aware embrace of those private events occasioned by one's history without unnecessary attempts to change their frequency or form[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).\n3.  **Values**: ACT allows therapists to include the client's values into the clinical or coaching work, ensuring that clients feel connected to and invested in the work[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/).\n\n4.  **Cognitive Defusion**: Cognitive defusion techniques attempt to alter the undesirable functions of thoughts and other private events, rather than trying to alter their form, frequency or situational sensitivity[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).\n\n5.  **Self-as-Context**: ACT promotes ongoing non-judgmental contact with psychological and environmental events as they occur[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).\n\n6.  **Committed Action**: ACT is all about helping clients cultivate psychological flexibility. The points of the hexaflex represent the six aspects of psychological flexibility[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). It is a person's ability to change their thinking and behavior when it is not serving them[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/).\n\nEach of these six domains corresponds to one of the core ACT principles, all of which have various activities and exercises to help the practitioner push their clients along[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). The goal of ACT is to increase psychological flexibility -- the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a conscious human being, and to change or persist in behavior when doing so serves valued ends[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).\n\n# ACT Hexaflex\n\n![[images/the-hexaflex.png]]\n\n# The Happiness Trap: Evolution of the Human Mind\n\n[The Happiness Trap: Evolution of the Human Mind - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kv6HkipQcfA)\n## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nThe human mind's evolution to prioritize safety and survival leads to modern psychological suffering patterns.\n\n## MAIN POINTS:\n\n1.  Caveman minds evolved to constantly watch for danger to ensure survival.\n2.  Modern minds inherited the default setting of prioritizing safety and avoiding harm.\n3.  The caveman mind triggers warnings about potential dangers to protect from harm.\n4.  Anxiety in modern times stems from the caveman mind's focus on predicting worst-case scenarios.\n5.  Replaying survival encounters was useful in the Stone Age but leads to dwelling in modern times.\n6.  Comparison to others was crucial for fitting in and surviving in the caveman era.\n7.  Modern life's constant comparison to a vast group intensifies fear of judgment and rejection.\n8.  Stone Age mentality of needing more for survival translates to modern greed and dissatisfaction.\n9.  The pace and complexity of modern life amplify Stone Age thought patterns.\n10. The mind's behavior is a result of evolution, aiming to keep individuals safe and prevent pain.\n\n## TAKEAWAYS:\n\n1.  Understand that the mind's focus on safety and survival can lead to psychological suffering.\n2.  Recognize that modern anxieties and comparisons stem from evolutionary traits for survival.\n3.  Be mindful of dwelling on past events unnecessarily, as it may not serve a useful purpose.\n4.  Acknowledge the impact of constant comparison in modern life on feelings of inadequacy.\n5.  Practice self-compassion and understanding towards the mind's evolutionary tendencies for self-preservation.\n\n# Mindfulness\n\n- Present moment awareness\n\n- On purpose\n\n- Without judgement\n\n- Jon Kabat-Zinn\n\n- Mindfulness Every Day Video Below\n\n- ☐ Look into 10% Happier App\n\n# Mindfulness Exercises\n\n- Breathing\n- Outside\n- Conversation\n- Eating\n\n# The Struggle Switch - By Dr. Russ Harris\n\n[Learn ACT with Russ Harris \\| Psychwire](https://psychwire.com/harris)\n[The Struggle Switch - By Dr. Russ Harris - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCp1l16GCXI)\n\\## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nStruggling with emotions amplifies them, but turning off the struggle switch allows for easier acceptance.\n\\## MAIN POINTS:\n1. Struggling with anxiety amplifies emotions and leads to more negative feelings.\n2. The struggle switch magnifies emotions like anger, sadness, and guilt.\n3. Amplified emotions can lead to self-defeating behaviors and feeling bogged down.\n4. Turning off the struggle switch allows emotions to move freely without amplification.\n5. Without struggling, anxiety can fluctuate naturally without getting bigger or stickier.\n6. Investing time in meaningful activities instead of struggling with emotions is beneficial.\n7. Accepting anxiety without struggling makes it easier to live with.\n8. The struggle switch can be turned off by choosing not to invest energy in struggling.\n9. Emotions have less impact and influence when the struggle switch is off.\n10. Everyone experiences anxiety, but how we deal with it affects its impact on our lives.\n\\## TAKEAWAYS:\n1. Accepting emotions without struggling reduces their impact.\n2. Investing time in meaningful activities can help manage emotions effectively.\n3. Turning off the struggle switch allows emotions to move freely and naturally.\n4. Struggling with emotions amplifies them and leads to negative feelings.\n5.
