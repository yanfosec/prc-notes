Here's how it works:\n\n1.  **Understanding Thought Patterns**: CBT helps individuals identify and understand their negative thought patterns and behaviors that contribute to anxiety[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu\u0026type=condition\u0026source=bingmainline_conditionqna).\n2.  **Changing Thought Patterns**: Once these negative thought patterns are identified, CBT works on changing them[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu\u0026type=condition\u0026source=bingmainline_conditionqna). This is done by challenging these thoughts and helping the individual replace them with more positive or realistic thoughts[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu\u0026type=condition\u0026source=bingmainline_conditionqna).\n3.  **Coping Skills**: CBT teaches individuals coping skills to manage their anxiety[1](https://microsoftstart.msn.com/en-us/health/ask-professionals/in-expert-answers-on-anxiety/in-anxiety?questionid=iilwh6zu\u0026type=condition\u0026source=bingmainline_conditionqna).

The brain receives many calls from the nervous system every day, prioritizing threats over non-threatening sensations.\n2.  In central sensitization, the brain becomes hyper-alert, treating even minor stimuli as danger signals.\n3.  This condition is characterized by increased pain processing in the brain, leading to symptoms like fatigue, nausea, and depression.\n4.  Central sensitization cannot be medicated away or relieved through medical procedures; instead, it requires rewiring the brain through behavioral changes.\n\n## TAKEAWAYS:\n\n1.  The brain can rewire itself throughout life, creating new pathways and connections.\n2.  Behavior plays a crucial role in maintaining or reversing central sensitization.\n3.  Adopting healthy behaviors that soothe the central nervous system can help alleviate symptoms of central sensitization.\n4.

Chronic pain can lead to significant physical and emotional decline.\n2.  Conventional treatments were ineffective, necessitating exploration of alternative methods.\n3.  Techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and guided imagery help manage pain.\n4.  Restoring normal sleep patterns is essential for recovery.\n5.  Establishing a daily routine promotes healthy habits and self-care.\n6.  Regular physical activity is important, even with chronic pain.\n7.  Occupational therapy helps resume enjoyable activities without worsening symptoms.\n8.  Social interactions and support groups offer emotional stability and encouragement.\n9.  Achieving small goals and finding new passions can improve motivation and happiness.\n10. The brain's interpretation of pain signals influences perception.\n\n## TAKEAWAYS:\n\n1.  Deep breathing and guided imagery effectively reduce stress, anxiety, and pain.\n2.  Consistently practicing self-care routines and physical activity is crucial for managing chronic pain.\n3.

This source provides a better understanding and management of the condition.\n2.  **The Lancet**: This is a highly respected medical journal that has published articles discussing the causes, therapies, and terminology related to central sensitization[2](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanrhe/PIIS2665-9913%2821%2900176-4.pdf).\n3.  **Wiley Online Library**: They have published articles on the neurobiology of central sensitization[3](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/jabr.12137?download=true).\n4.  **Mayo Clinic**: They have resources describing the pathophysiology of central sensitization[4](https://ce.mayo.edu/sites/default/files/media/2022-07/Wed_0710_Aakre_Central%20sensitization%20pathophysiology.pdf).\n\n# Overview\n\nCentral sensitization is a condition of the nervous system that is associated with the development and maintenance of chronic pain[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization). Here's a detailed explanation:\n\n1.  **What is Central Sensitization?**: When central sensitization occurs, the nervous system goes through a process called wind-up and gets regulated in a persistent state of high reactivity[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization). This persistent, or regulated, state of reactivity lowers the threshold for what causes pain and subsequently comes to maintain pain even after the initial injury might have healed[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization).\n2.  **Characteristics**: Central sensitization has two main characteristics. Both involve a heightened sensitivity to pain and the sensation of touch. They are called allodynia and hyperalgesia[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization). Allodynia occurs when a person experiences pain with things that are normally not painful. For example, chronic pain patients often experience pain even with things as simple as touch or massage[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization). Hyperalgesia is an increased sensitivity to painful stimuli[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization).\n3.  **Changes in the Nervous System**: In central sensitization, the central nervous system undergoes structural, functional, and chemical changes that make it more sensitive to pain and other sensory stimuli[2](https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/4/245). This process is often referred to as the \"wind-up\" phenomenon[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization).\n4.  **Role in Chronic Pain**: Central sensitization is a key mechanism in the development of chronic pain[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization). It provides an explanatory framework for various frequently encountered conditions[2](https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/4/245). Patient education about pain physiology and central sensitization can improve quality of life and functional status, and reduce anxiety and catastrophization[2](https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/4/245).\n5.  **Treatment**: Cognitive behavior therapy aims to reframe negative thoughts, emotions, and behaviors as positive ones[2](https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/4/245). When patients have chronic pain or other symptoms that seem out of proportion to anything we can tell is physically wrong with them, we should not assume they are faking it[2](https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/4/245). The central nervous system can undergo changes---structural, functional, and chemical---that make it more sensitive to stimuli, a process called central sensitization[2](https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/4/245).\n\nRemember, central sensitization is a complex process that plays a significant role in the perception and maintenance of chronic pain[1](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/central-sensitization). Understanding this process can help in the management of chronic pain conditions[2](https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/4/245).\n\n# Published Papers\n\n1.  **\"Central sensitization, chronic pain, and other symptoms: Better understanding, better management\"**: This paper, published in the Cleveland Clinic Journal of Medicine, discusses the pathophysiological process of central sensitization and its role in various conditions where patients have unexplained pain and fatigue[1](https://www.ccjm.org/content/90/4/245).\n2.  **\"Central sensitisation: causes, therapies, and terminology\"**: This correspondence, published in The Lancet, discusses the potential of central sensitization for precision medicine in rheumatology[2](https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lanrhe/PIIS2665-9913%2821%2900176-4.pdf).\n3.  **\"Research on central sensitization of endometriosis-associated pain\"**: This review aims to systematically synthesize the literature published to date regarding the central sensitization mechanism of endometriosis-associated pain[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.2147/JPR.S197667).\n4.  **\"PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF CENTRAL SENSITIZATION\"**: This paper defines central sensitization and recognizes common central sensitization syndromes. It also describes microscopic neurological mechanisms leading to central sensitization[4](https://ce.mayo.edu/sites/default/files/media/2022-07/Wed_0710_Aakre_Central%20sensitization%20pathophysiology.pdf).\n5.  **\"Central Sensitization in Humans: Assessment and Pharmacology\"**: This paper discusses how human experimental pain models and quantitative sensory testing (QST) can be used to profile the efficacy of new drugs[5](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-662-46450-2_5).\n\nThese papers provide a comprehensive understanding of central sensitization, its causes, effects, and potential treatments.\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.619655503Z","tags":["PRC","central_sensitization"]},"/Source/PRC-Communication":{"title":"PRC - Communication","content":"\n# Communication\n\nVerbal and non-verbal way of conveying thoughts\n\n# Why does it matter?\n\n- Help solve problems\n- Improve soft skills\n- Increase independence\n- Prepare teens young adults for success in school, employment, and other settings\n- Help families move away from symptom focused behaviors\n- Help re-establish healthy reoles\n\n# Assertive Communication using \"I\" Statements\n\n- I've noticed\n- I feel\n- Because\n- I want / prefer\n- What you tyour thoughts\n\n\u003e \\[!idea\\] Most Important...\n\u003e Most important part of communication is... **LISTENING**\n\n# Active Listening\n\n- Pause\n  - Don't jump in or interrupt\n- Practice patience and open mind (BREATHE!)\n- Practice Reflective Listening\n  - \"Is that right? Did I hear you correctly?\"\n\nActive listening is a crucial skill that can improve communication and build stronger relationships. Here are some tips to enhance your active listening skills:\n1. **Pay Attention**: Give the speaker your undivided attention. Put aside distracting thoughts and avoid being distracted by environmental factors.\n2. **Show That You're Listening**: Use your body language to show you're engaged. Nod occasionally, maintain eye contact, and use small verbal comments like \"yes\" or \"uh huh\" to show you're involved in the conversation.\n3. **Provide Feedback**: Reflect on what's been said by paraphrasing. \"What I'm hearing is...\" or \"It sounds like you're saying...\" are great ways to provide feedback.\n4. **Defer Judgment**: Allow the speaker to finish their point before you ask questions. Interrupting is a barrier to effective communication.\n5. **Respond Appropriately**: Active listening is a model for respect and understanding. Be candid, open, and honest in your response.\n\n# Reflective Listening\n\nReflective listening is a communication strategy involving two key steps: understanding the speaker and also sharing that understanding back to the speaker. It's a way of \"reflecting\" the speaker's words and feelings back to them. Here are some examples:\n\n1.  **Paraphrasing**: This involves restating the speaker's words in your own words. For example, if the speaker says, \"I'm feeling overwhelmed with my workload,\" you might say, \"It sounds like you have too much on your plate right now.\"\n2.  **Reflecting Feelings**: This involves identifying the speaker's emotions and expressing them back. For example, if the speaker seems upset about a recent argument, you might say, \"It seems like that argument really upset you.\"\n3.  **Reflecting Meanings**: This involves understanding the speaker's message and reflecting it back. For example, if the speaker is talking about a difficult decision they made, you might say, \"You're wondering if you made the right choice.\"\n4.  **Summarizing**: This involves bringing together the speaker's thoughts and expressing them in a brief statement. For example, after a long conversation, you might say, \"So, you're not happy with your job because of the workload, and you're considering other options.\"\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.619655503Z","tags":["PRC"]},"/Source/PRC-Consequences":{"title":"PRC - Consequences","content":"\n# Consequences Overview\n\n- It's much more difficult to force consequences than rewards, especially with kids with chronic illnesses.\n\n- Overdoing rewards will not help in the long run.\n\n- Once you reward positives, that becomes the only reason.

They can be natural (occurring naturally without any intervention) or logical (specifically planned by parents or other adults[1](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/punishments-vs-consequences-which-are-you-using/). Consequences are intended to teach individuals to take responsibility for their actions and learn from their mistakes[2](https://pediaa.com/difference-between-consequences-and-punishment/). They respect the individual's right to make a decision, even if it's not a good one[1](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/punishments-vs-consequences-which-are-you-using/). Consequences are not a withdrawal of love or a rejection, but a matter-of-fact learning experience in which accountability is maintained[1](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/punishments-vs-consequences-which-are-you-using/).\n\n**Punishments**, on the other hand, are intentionally negative actions put upon someone as a result of a specific behavior[3](https://thebigbiemethod.com/consequences-vs-punishments-what-is-the-difference/). The goal of punishment is to make the individual pay or suffer until they make the choice that the punisher wants them to make[1](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/punishments-vs-consequences-which-are-you-using/). Punishments arise out of anger and fear and often look like a withdrawal of love in order to get the individual to do what the punisher wants[1](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/punishments-vs-consequences-which-are-you-using/). This approach doesn't help individuals develop new ways of taking responsibility for their behavior and can be destructive to the relationship[1](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/punishments-vs-consequences-which-are-you-using/).\n\nIn summary, consequences are about teaching and accountability, while punishments are about control and retribution[4](https://psychcentral.com/blog/childhood-behavioral/2018/09/the-difference-between-a-consequence-and-a-punishment)[1](https://www.empoweringparents.com/article/punishments-vs-consequences-which-are-you-using/)[5](https://www.smarterparenting.com/podcasts/consequence-vs-punishment/). It's important to note that the effectiveness of consequences and punishments can vary greatly depending on the context and the individual involved. Always consider the individual's needs, the situation, and the potential impacts when deciding between consequences and punishments.\n\n# Another explanation\n\nIn the context of behavioral theory, particularly operant conditioning, both consequences and punishments are used to influence behavior[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html). However, they have different purposes and effects:\n\n**Consequences** are the outcomes that follow a behavior. They can be either positive or negative, and they are intended to reinforce the behavior, making it more likely to occur in the future[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html). Consequences focus on learning, reflection, and personal growth, allowing individuals to understand the effects of their actions and make better choices[2](https://www.rosycheeked.com/mental-health/consequences-vs-punishment-whats-the-difference/). They can be natural (occurring naturally without any intervention) or logical (specifically planned by parents or other adults)[3](https://psychcentral.com/blog/childhood-behavioral/2018/09/the-difference-between-a-consequence-and-a-punishment). A consequence is meant to teach, maintain accountability, and maintain safety[3](https://psychcentral.com/blog/childhood-behavioral/2018/09/the-difference-between-a-consequence-and-a-punishment).\n\n**Punishments**, on the other hand, are intentionally negative outcomes that are applied in response to undesirable behavior[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html). The goal of punishment is to decrease the likelihood of the behavior occurring again in the future[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/operant-conditioning.html). Punishments tend to focus solely on the negative behavior. This tends to simply force a child into following a parent's order without any decision-making skills being taught[4](https://psychologynj.org/page/PunishmentvsConsequences). The motivation behind a punishment comes from a place of emotion and a need to maintain control[3](https://psychcentral.com/blog/childhood-behavioral/2018/09/the-difference-between-a-consequence-and-a-punishment). Punishments can come in the form of drastic measures, such as physical abuse or starvation, but they can also show up in much smaller, less noticeable ways[3](https://psychcentral.com/blog/childhood-behavioral/2018/09/the-difference-between-a-consequence-and-a-punishment).\n\nIn summary, consequences are about teaching and accountability, while punishments are about control and retribution[3](https://psychcentral.com/blog/childhood-behavioral/2018/09/the-difference-between-a-consequence-and-a-punishment)[2](https://www.rosycheeked.com/mental-health/consequences-vs-punishment-whats-the-difference/)[4](https://psychologynj.org/page/PunishmentvsConsequences).

These interventions are grounded in empirical evidence, clinical expertise, and patient characteristics.\n\nIn the context of depression treatment, evidence-based practice (EBP) aims to optimize the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions. It encourages therapists to use the best available research evidence to make informed decisions about patient care.\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines evidence-based practice in psychotherapy as \"the integration of the best available research with clinical expertise in the context of patient characteristics, culture, and preferences\". This means that therapists should use their professional judgment to make collaborative decisions with the patient, based on the best clinically relevant evidence. They should consider the probable costs and benefits of different treatments, available resources, and the patient's preferences.\n\nIn the field of mental health, evidence-based methods and interventions are those that have been proven effective. The effects are clearly linked to the activities, themselves, not to outside, unrelated events.\n\nA typical evidence-based intervention for depression might include value-finding exercises. Identifying what matters to the patient and what they want their life to be about can positively impact wellbeing and help manage depression. Other evidence-based interventions for depression might include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), interpersonal therapy (IPT), and certain types of medication. These treatments have been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of depression and improving quality of life.\n\n# CBT\n\nCognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is a widely used and effective treatment for depression[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression). It's a type of psychotherapy that uses a combination of cognitive and behavioral approaches to reduce depression[2](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/cbt-for-depression/). Here's how it works:\n\n1.  **Identify and Challenge Negative Thoughts**: CBT helps you spot and challenge automatic negative thoughts linked to depression, like feeling helpless, hopeless, or worthless[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression).\n2.  **Restructure Cognitive Patterns**: A therapist will work with you to reframe your interpretation of life events, altering any core beliefs that contribute to depressive symptoms[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression).\n3.  **Develop Coping Strategies**: CBT teaches effective coping skills and problem-solving techniques to handle challenging situations[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression).\n4.  **Behavioral Activation**: Your CBT therapist will encourage you to do enjoyable things to fight against feeling withdrawn and inactive, common feelings in depression[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression).\n5.  **Relapse Prevention**: CBT not only treats current symptoms but also focuses on preventing future relapses by teaching strategies to maintain healthier thoughts and behavior patterns[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression).\n\nCBT can be an effective treatment for various depressive disorders and episodes that may be impacting your life, especially in the mild to moderate range of symptoms[2](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/cbt-for-depression/). These include Major Depressive Disorder (clinical depression), Persistent Depressive Disorder (PDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder, Postpartum Depression, the depressive episodes of Bipolar Disorder, Situational Depression, and Schizoaffective Disorder, depressive type[2](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/cbt-for-depression/).\n\nStudies demonstrate that combining CBT with medication is more effective than medication alone, and individuals undergoing CBT experience reduced relapse rates[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression). Even after therapy concluded, the benefits persisted[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression).\n\nIt's important to note that the effectiveness of CBT can depend on the individual's willingness to participate actively, their ability to identify their emotions, their preference for non-medication approaches, and their commitment to regular therapy sessions[1](https://psychcentral.com/depression/cbt-for-depression).\n\n# Understanding Emotions\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"PRC%20-%20Depression-media/df551ff9dbff564d5df0d196b85312414db21995.png\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\" alt=\"Pastedimage20240522150749.png\" /\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\naria-hidden=\"true\"\u003ePastedimage20240522150749.png\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"PRC%20-%20Depression-media/fbc74af719c6f9cc2e5233e0175b01fe2c2ff36f.png\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\" alt=\"Pastedimage20240522151106.png\" /\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\naria-hidden=\"true\"\u003ePastedimage20240522151106.png\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n# Thinking Traps\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"PRC%20-%20Depression-media/ca5dc0cd32e723e435477795eb055e6a3fc883da.png\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\" alt=\"Pastedimage20240522151205.png\" /\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\naria-hidden=\"true\"\u003ePastedimage20240522151205.png\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.627655511Z","tags":["PRC"]},"/Source/PRC-Diaphragmatic-Breathing":{"title":"PRC - Diaphragmatic Breathing","content":"\n# Why it works\n\n- Science!\n- Activates the parasympathetic nervous system\n- Changes balance of our blood chemistry\n- Helps manage symptoms\n\n# Breathing and the Nervous System\n\n[How does deep breathing help?

**sympathetic** and **parasympathetic** nervous systems are both components of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), which regulates the involuntary and reflexive functions of the human body[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n\nHere are the key differences between the two:\n\n1.  **Origin**: The sympathetic nervous system originates in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord, while the parasympathetic nervous system originates in the sacral region of the spinal cord and the medulla[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n2.  **Key Function**: The sympathetic nervous system controls the body's response to perceived threats (fight or flight), while the parasympathetic nervous system regulates the body's functions at rest (rest and digest[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n3.  **Effect on Heart Rate**: The sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate, while the parasympathetic nervous system decreases heart rate[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n4.  **Effect on Lungs**: The sympathetic nervous system causes bronchial tubes to dilate, while the parasympathetic nervous system causes bronchial tubes to contract[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n5.  **Effect on Muscles**: The sympathetic nervous system causes muscles to contract, while the parasympathetic nervous system causes muscles to relax[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n6.  **Effect on Pupils**: The sympathetic nervous system causes pupils to dilate, while the parasympathetic nervous system causes pupils to constrict[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n7.  **Effect on Digestive System**: The sympathetic nervous system decreases digestive function, while the parasympathetic nervous system increases digestive function[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n8.  **Effect on Saliva Production**: The sympathetic nervous system decreases saliva production, while the parasympathetic nervous system increases saliva production[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n9.  **Effect on Mucus Production**: The sympathetic nervous system decreases mucus production, while the parasympathetic nervous system increases mucus production[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n10. **Effect on Urine Secretion**: The sympathetic nervous system decreases urine secretion, while the parasympathetic nervous system increases urine secretion[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n11. **Effect on Glycogen to Glucose Conversion**: The sympathetic nervous system increases the conversion of glycogen to glucose, while the parasympathetic nervous system does not[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n\nIn summary, the sympathetic nervous system prepares the body for action, while the parasympathetic nervous system helps the body to relax and recover[1](https://biologydictionary.net/sympathetic-vs-parasympathetic-nervous-system/)[2](https://byjus.com/biology/difference-between-sympathetic-and-parasympathetic/).\n\n# Parasympathetic Response Activation\n\n[Diaphragm - 3D Medical Animation \\|\\| ABP © - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23-KAubf-js)\nActivating the parasympathetic response, also known as the \"rest and digest\" response, can help you manage stress and promote relaxation. Here are some techniques you can try:\n\n1.  **Deep Breathing**: Deep abdominal breathing exercises can quickly relax you because it stimulates your parasympathetic nervous system[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System)[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/)[3](https://healthnews.com/family-health/healthy-living/how-to-activate-the-parasympathetic-nervous-system/). You can try simple \"box breathing\" where you inhale for four counts, hold your breath at the \"top\" for four counts, exhale for four counts, hold your breath at the \"bottom\" for four counts[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System).\n2.  **Visualization**: Visualize yourself in a relaxing situation. Pick an image that feels comfortable to you, such as a peaceful beach, a sunny hillside, or a trickling mountain stream[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System).\n3.  **Touching Your Lips**: Your lips are connected to parasympathetic fibers, which are stimulated when you touch your lips. Gently slide 1 or 2 fingers over your lips to activate these nerve fibers[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System)[3](https://healthnews.com/family-health/healthy-living/how-to-activate-the-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n4.  **Meditation**: Spend 10 minutes quieting your mind and focusing on your breathing[3](https://healthnews.com/family-health/healthy-living/how-to-activate-the-parasympathetic-nervous-system/).\n5.  **Mild Exercise**: Engage in mild exercise like yoga or a nature walk[4](https://www.hss.edu/article_parasympathetic-nervous-system.asp).\n6.  **Massage**: Getting a massage can stimulate the parasympathetic nervous system[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/).\n7.  **Acupuncture**: This procedure has the ability to stimulate the vagus nerve and other key areas of the nervous system, and to increase the release of acetylcholine[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/).\n8.  **Ear Seeds**: Ear seeds are actual or synthetic seeds or similar small objects that are being used to stimulate pressure points in the ear[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/).\n9.  **Nature Therapy**: Simply immersing yourself in nature can help the body achieve physiological relaxation[2](https://healyournervoussystem.com/45-techniques-to-activate-your-parasympathetic-nervous-system-and-lower-stress/).\n\nRemember, these techniques are not meant to solve problems or control emotions, but to calm the body and mind so that problems can be solved more effectively[5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpKpW0EhYo)[6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPH5CFSmYEU)[7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5WbXDnZ1Wg). If you do these things consistently, you should feel more relaxed. However, you might need to do it several times a day to help you deal with chronic stress[1](https://www.wikihow.com/Activate-the-Parasympathetic-Nervous-System).\n\n[Parasympathetic Response: Train Your Nervous System to Turn off Stress: Anxiety Skills \\#11 - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8FpKpW0EhYo\u0026t=8s)\n\n# How to do it\n\n\u003e \\[!NOTE\\]\n\u003e It's not about deep breathing, but rather about paced breathing\n\n\u003e \\[!Goal\\] Goal\n\u003e 6-8 breaths per minute\n\n1.  **Position**: Begin by lying down on a flat surface with a pillow under your head and pillows beneath your knees for comfort[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing). You can also practice this sitting up straight in a comfortable position once you've mastered the technique[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974).\n2.  **Hand Placement**: Place one hand on your chest and the other on your belly, just below your ribs[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing)[3](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lungs-breathing-and-respiration/diaphragmatic-breathing)[4](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing).\n3.  **Inhale**: Breathe in slowly through your nose, drawing the breath down toward your stomach. Your stomach should push upward against your hand, while your chest remains still[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing)[3](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lungs-breathing-and-respiration/diaphragmatic-breathing)[4](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing).\n4.  **Exhale**: Tighten your abdominal muscles and let your stomach fall downward while exhaling through pursed lips[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing). Again, the chest should remain still[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing)[3](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lungs-breathing-and-respiration/diaphragmatic-breathing)[4](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing).\n5.  **Pace**: Do not over-breathe. Usually, a pace of breathing in to the count of 3, pause, then exhale to the count of 3 is a good place to start[5](https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/adult-pain-medicine/newsfeed-post/diaphragmatic-breathing-why-it-is-the-secret-weapon-against-chronic-pain/).\n6.  **Duration**: Practice this breathing exercise for 5--10 minutes at a time, around three to four times each day[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing).\n\nRemember, diaphragmatic breathing is a skill that takes time to learn. Be patient with yourself and practice regularly. Over time, you'll likely find that this type of deep, intentional breathing becomes more natural[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/diaphragmatic-breathing-how-to-benefits-and-exercises-5219974)[1](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/diaphragmatic-breathing)[3](https://www.healthgrades.com/right-care/lungs-breathing-and-respiration/diaphragmatic-breathing)[4](https://www.health.harvard.edu/healthbeat/learning-diaphragmatic-breathing)[5](https://connect.mayoclinic.org/blog/adult-pain-medicine/newsfeed-post/diaphragmatic-breathing-why-it-is-the-secret-weapon-against-chronic-pain/).\n\n### Video Tutorials\n\n1.

It involves gradually and repeatedly exposing a person to the feared object, situation, or thought until the person becomes less anxious[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). Here's how it works:\n\n1.  **Understanding the Fear**: The first step in exposure therapy is to understand the fear or anxiety trigger[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). This could be a specific object, situation, or thought[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\n2.  **Creating an Exposure Hierarchy**: The therapist and the person work together to create an \"exposure hierarchy\", which is a list of situations that provoke fear or anxiety, arranged in order from least to most anxiety-provoking[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\n3.  **Gradual Exposure**: The person is then gradually exposed to each situation on the hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-provoking[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). The exposure is repeated until the person's anxiety decreases[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\n4.  **Facing the Fear**: Over time, the person works their way up the hierarchy, facing increasingly difficult situations until they can face their biggest fears[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\n5.  **Breaking the Cycle**: The goal of exposure therapy is to break the cycle of avoidance that maintains the anxiety disorder[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). By facing their fears, the person learns that their anxiety and fear are manageable and that they have the ability to cope[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\nExposure therapy can be conducted in several ways, including in vivo (real-life), imaginal (imagination), and interoceptive (triggering physical sensations)[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). The type of exposure used depends on the nature of the person's fear[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\nExposure therapy has been found to be effective for a range of anxiety disorders, including phobias, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\nHere are some published works on exposure therapy:\n\n1.  **\"Exposure Therapy: What It Is, What It Treats \u0026 Types - Cleveland Clinic\"**[2](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25067-exposure-therapy): This article provides an overview of exposure therapy, including its uses and types[2](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/25067-exposure-therapy).\n2.  **\"What Is Exposure Therapy? How It Can Help Anxiety Disorders\"**[3](https://www.simplypsychology.org/exposure-therapy.html): This article discusses how exposure therapy works and its effectiveness in treating anxiety disorders[3](https://www.simplypsychology.org/exposure-therapy.html).\n3.  **\"Exposure Therapy: Definition, Techniques, and Efficacy - Verywell Mind\"**[4](https://www.verywellmind.com/exposure-therapy-definition-techniques-and-efficacy-5190514): This article explains the process of exposure therapy and its efficacy[4](https://www.verywellmind.com/exposure-therapy-definition-techniques-and-efficacy-5190514).\n4.  **\"7 Types of Exposure Therapy for Anxiety - Choosing Therapy\"**[5](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/exposure-therapy-for-anxiety/): This article discusses the different types of exposure therapies for anxiety[5](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/exposure-therapy-for-anxiety/).\n\nRemember, while exposure therapy can be highly effective, it's not a quick fix. It requires effort and practice. But for many people, it can lead to significant improvement in their anxiety symptoms and quality of life[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\n# Thought Exposure\n\nThought exposure, also known as imaginal exposure, is a specific type of exposure therapy that involves vividly imagining the feared object, situation, or activity[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). It's similar to traditional exposure therapy, but instead of directly facing a feared object or situation in real life (in vivo exposure), the person is asked to imagine the feared object or situation[2](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapy-types/written-exposure-therapy).\n\nHere's how thought exposure works:\n1. **Understanding the Fear**: The first step is to understand the fear or anxiety trigger[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). This could be a specific thought or scenario that triggers anxiety[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n2. **Creating an Exposure Hierarchy**: The therapist and the person work together to create an \"exposure hierarchy\", which is a list of situations that provoke fear or anxiety, arranged in order from least to most anxiety-provoking[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n3. **Imaginal Exposure**: The person is then asked to vividly imagine each situation on the hierarchy, starting with the least anxiety-provoking[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). The exposure is repeated until the person's anxiety decreases[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n4. **Facing the Fear**: Over time, the person works their way up the hierarchy, facing increasingly difficult situations until they can face their biggest fears[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n5. **Breaking the Cycle**: The goal of thought exposure is to break the cycle of avoidance that maintains the anxiety disorder[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). By facing their fears, the person learns that their anxiety and fear are manageable and that they have the ability to cope[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n\nThought exposure can be particularly useful when the feared objects or situations are not easily accessible or too distressing to confront in real life[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy). It's been found to be effective for a range of anxiety disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)[1](https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/patients-and-families/exposure-therapy).\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.627655511Z","tags":["anxiety","CBT"]},"/Source/PRC-Gratitude":{"title":"PRC - Gratitude","content":"\n# Gratitude: Research Supprted Benefits\n\n# Gratitude Improves Resilience\n\n- Linked to increased\n  - Optimism\n  - lifensatisfaction\n  - lower negative affect\n  - better experience in school\n\n# Neuroscience\n\n- When practicing gratitude\n- Neurochemicals associated with improved mood\n  Stress hormones decrease\n\nNeurons that fire together wire together\n\n# Five depths of gratitude video\n\n[Five Depths of Gratitude - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwPtJ6yjl8E)\n\n1.  **Ungrateful**: At this level, people don't know how to be grateful. They feel supremely entitled and harbor callous disregard for others' preferences¹.\n2.  **Special**: People at this level use gratitude as a temporary escape into virtue so they don't feel so selfish in their hedonistic drive. Gratitude in them is an occasional companion, often contingent on something big and special happening, and generally doesn't translate into prosocial actions¹.\n3.  **Daily Plea**: These people are grateful for the small and simple things. They are aware that what they receive is a collective effort of millions. Grateful thoughts visit their mind on most days and translate into occasional actions geared to help the world¹.\n4.  **Regular Things - Everything**: People at this level have gratitude as their constant companion. They are content and have a very low threshold for happiness. Their personal needs are small, their thoughts predominantly prosocial. They still wish to acquire, but only so they can give more¹.\n5.  **Adversity**: Finally, there are people who are grateful even for adversities. They live in a state of surrender. Every experience to them is a meaningful gift. They have transcended the duality of good and bad¹.\n\nThese levels represent a journey from a state of ingratitude to a state of constant gratitude, even in the face of adversity. It's a transformative process that can lead to increased resilience and overall well-being¹.\n\n(1) Something to Think About: Five depths of gratitude. https://newsnetwork.mayoclinic.org/discussion/something-to-think-about-five-depths-of-gratitude-3/.\n(2) Give the Gift of Gratitude \\| In the Loop - Mayo Clinic. https://intheloop.mayoclinic.org/2015/12/01/give-the-gift-of-gratitude/.\n(3) Stress-Free Living With Dr. Amit Sood - WPR - Wisconsin Public Radio. https://bing.com/search?q=five+levels+of+gratitude+Amit+Sood.\n(4) Stress-Free Living With Dr. Amit Sood - WPR - Wisconsin Public Radio. https://www.wpr.org/shows/larry-meiller-show/stress-free-living-dr-amit-sood.\n(5) The Mayo Clinic Guide to Stress-Free Living by Amit Sood \\| Review .... https://www.spiritualityandpractice.com/book-reviews/view/25881/the-mayo-clinic-guide-to-stress-free-living.\n(6) Amit Sood: Q\u0026A About Finding Resilience to Chronic Stress Through .... https://www.everydayhealth.com/wellness/united-states-of-stress/advisory-board/amit-sood-md-q-a/.\n(7) en.wikipedia.org. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Sood.\\\u003e)\n\n# How to practice Gratitude?\n\n- Gratitude Journal\n- Tell people you are grateful for them\n- Reflect on things in the past - Something positive\n- Thanks\n- Gratitude Photo Journal\n- Write a letter\n- Visit someone you appreciate\n- Volunteer\n- Gratitude Walk\n\n[How to cultivate a gratitude practice -- Johns Hopkins University Student Well-Being](https://wellbeing.jhu.edu/blog/2021/11/09/how-to-cultivate-a-gratitude-practice/)\n\n[(PDF) 'The Three Good Things' -- The effects of gratitude practice on wellbeing: A randomised controlled trial](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313845439_%27The_Three_Good_Things%27_-_The_effects_of_gratitude_practice_on_wellbeing_A_randomised_controlled_trial)\n\n1.  **Keep a Gratitude Journal**: Spend a few minutes each day writing down what you are grateful for.

Recovery","content":"\n# Growth Mindset and Chronic Pain Recovery\n\nFixed mindset is all about accepting limitations\nGrowth mindset is all about the confidence in evolving and growing with effort\n\\## Definitions\n\nThe difference between a **growth mindset** and a **fixed mindset** in the context of child development and parenting.\n\n1.  **Fixed Mindset**: This mindset is based on the belief that a person's abilities, intelligence, and talents are fixed traits that cannot be significantly changed or developed. Children with a fixed mindset may avoid challenges because they fear failure, and they may give up easily when they encounter obstacles. They often view criticism as a personal attack and feel threatened by the success of others. In a fixed mindset, the focus is on proving oneself rather than improving oneself.\n\n2.  **Growth Mindset**: This mindset, on the other hand, is based on the belief that a person's abilities and intelligence can be developed through dedication, hard work, and the right kind of guidance. Children with a growth mindset embrace challenges, persist in the face of setbacks, see effort as a path to mastery, learn from criticism, and find lessons and inspiration in the success of others. They believe they can get smarter or more talented if they work hard and persevere.\n\nAs a behavioral child therapist, it's important to encourage a growth mindset in children. This can be done by praising effort rather than innate ability, teaching children that it's okay to make mistakes and that they can learn from them, and promoting the idea that abilities and intelligence can be developed. A growth mindset can help children become more resilient, persistent, and motivated to learn. It can also contribute to their overall well-being and success in life.\n\nRemember, the goal is not to completely eliminate the fixed mindset, but to promote a balance where the child understands that while some things may come more naturally to them, they can still grow and improve in other areas through effort and perseverance. It's about teaching them that they have the capacity to learn, grow, and overcome challenges, which is a powerful lesson that will serve them well throughout their lives.\n\n## Examples\n\nHere are some examples of **fixed** and **growth** mindsets:\n\n**Fixed Mindset Examples:**\n1. \"I'm just not good at math.\" This statement implies that the ability to do math is an innate talent that can't be changed.\n2. \"I can't draw. I'm not an artist.\" This suggests that artistic ability is a fixed trait, and if you don't have it, you can't develop it.\n3. \"I tried playing the guitar once, but I was terrible. I'm just not musical.\" This indicates a belief that musical ability is something you either have or you don't.\n\n**Growth Mindset Examples:**\n1. \"I didn't do well on this test, but I'll study harder for the next one.\" This shows a belief that performance can be improved with effort.\n2. \"I'm not a great writer yet, but I can become one if I keep practicing and learning.\" This demonstrates a belief in the ability to develop new skills over time.\n3. \"I can't do this...yet.\" The word \"yet\" is powerful in a growth mindset, indicating a belief in the potential for change and improvement.\n\nRemember, the key difference between the two mindsets is the belief about whether abilities and talents can be developed (growth mindset) or are fixed traits (fixed mindset). Encouraging a growth mindset can help children see challenges as opportunities for growth and learning, rather than as insurmountable obstacles. It's about the journey of learning, not just the destination.\n\n# Carol Dweck - A Study on Praise and Mindsets\n\n[Carol Dweck - A Study on Praise and Mindsets -

children's development, revealing significant differences between praising intelligence and effort.\n\\## IDEAS:\n- Carol D's study involved over 400 fifth-grade students from across the nation.\n- Children were given a simple nonverbal IQ test with 10 questions.\n- Two groups were formed: one praised for intelligence, the other for effort.\n- Praising intelligence led 67% of children to choose an easier subsequent test.\n- Praising effort led 92% of children to choose a harder subsequent test.\n- Praising intelligence can lead to a fixed mindset, limiting growth.\n- Praising effort encourages a growth mindset, promoting learning and resilience.\n- Children praised for effort worked harder and enjoyed difficult tasks more.\n- Children praised for intelligence got frustrated and gave up more easily.\n- Final test results showed a 50% performance difference between the two groups.\n- Intelligence-praised group's scores dropped by 20% on the final test.\n- Effort-praised group's scores increased by nearly 30% on the final test.\n- Subtle differences in praise can significantly impact a child's development.\n- Teachers, coaches, and parents should focus on praising effort over intelligence.\n- Growth mindset positively impacts development in various life areas.\n- Praising strategies and hard work fosters long-term growth and resilience.\n- Fixed mindset leads to playing it safe and avoiding challenges.\n- Growth mindset encourages taking on hard tasks and intense practice.\n- Mistakes are seen as opportunities for growth in a growth mindset.\n- Research shows growth mindset has a big impact on child development.\n\\## INSIGHTS\n- Subtle differences in praise can significantly impact children's development and mindset.\n- Praising effort encourages children to embrace challenges and develop resilience.\n- Fixed mindsets limit growth by making children avoid risks and challenges.\n- Growth mindsets foster long-term development by valuing effort and learning.\n- Children praised for effort enjoy difficult tasks more than those praised for intelligence.\n- Intelligence-praised children tend to give up more easily when faced with challenges.\n- Effort-praised children show significant improvement in performance over time.\n- Teachers and parents should focus on praising the process, not innate abilities.\n- Growth mindset positively affects performance in academics, sports, and life.\n- Mistakes are viewed as learning opportunities in a growth mindset.\n\\## QUOTES:\n- \"Wow great job you must be really smart at this.\"\n- \"Wow great job you must have worked really really hard at this.\"\n- \"67% of them chose the easier option while 92% of the kids who were praised for their effort chose the harder test.\"\n- \"They enter a fixed mindset, they play it safe in the future and they limit their growth.\"\n- \"It's about the process of growth.\"\n- \"If I don't take on hard things and stick to them, I'm not going to grow.\"\n- \"The group that was praised for effort worked hard harder longer and actually enjoyed this test more.\"\n- \"The group that was praised for their intelligence actually did worse on this test than the first one.\"\n- \"Their average score actually dropped by 20% while the group that was praised for their effort did significantly better raising their average score by nearly 30%.\"\n- \"This study shows how praise can either make or break a child's development.\"\n- \"We need to be very careful about praising someone's intelligence or abilities and focus more on the process and the effort that they put forth.\"\n- \"Having a growth mindset has a big time impact on the development of a child whether on the court in the classroom or just in life.\"\n\\## HABITS\n- Focus on praising children's

This process can make the nervous system more sensitive to stimuli, leading to an increased response to pain[2](https://coloradopaincare.com/understanding-peripheral-and-central-sensitization/).\n\nPain behavior, in this context, refers to the set of verbal and nonverbal expressions that accompany the experience of pain. These behaviors can range from verbal reports to nonverbal expressions like facial grimacing, and they can provide valuable information about a person's pain experience[3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78340-6_6).\n\n**Verbal pain behaviors** include:\n\n- Vocal complaints: Words expressing discomfort or pain, such as \"ouch,\" \"that hurts,\" or other exclamations of protest[4](https://www.chisaintjosephhealth.org/content/dam/stjoseph-ky/pdfs/nursing/cnpi.pdf).\n- Descriptions of the pain: For example, a person might say, \"I feel pain in my shoulder that is quite strong\"[3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78340-6_6).\n\n**Nonverbal pain behaviors** include:\n\n- Facial expressions: Grimacing, furrowed brow, holding eyes tightly shut, pursed lips[5](https://faithandhopehospice.com/non-verbal-signs-of-pain/).\n- Body language: Clenching fists or blankets, rigid body, unusual breathing patterns[5](https://faithandhopehospice.com/non-verbal-signs-of-pain/).\n- Other indicators: Moaning, yelling, crying, jaw tightening, grinding teeth[6](https://parentishealth.com/recognize-non-verbal-pain-cues/).\n\nIt's important to note that these behaviors can vary greatly among individuals and may be influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural background, personal beliefs about pain, and previous pain experiences. Therefore, understanding and interpreting these behaviors requires a comprehensive and individualized approach.\n\nSure, here are some more examples of verbal and non-verbal pain behaviors:\n\n**Verbal Pain Behaviors**:\n\n- Requests for help: Asking for medication, assistance, or comfort[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78340-6_6).\n- Pain ratings: Providing a numerical or descriptive rating of pain intensity[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/pain-assessment-1131968).\n- Descriptions of the type of pain: Using words like \"sharp,\" \"dull,\" \"throbbing,\" or \"burning\" to describe the pain[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/pain-assessment-1131968).\n- Expressions of distress or discomfort: Statements like \"I can't stand this anymore\" or \"This is really bothering me\"[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78340-6_6).\n\n**Non-Verbal Pain Behaviors**:\n\n- Changes in activity levels: Decreased mobility, reluctance to move, changes in sleep patterns[3](https://geriatricpain.org/sites/geriatricpain.org/files/2023-06/CNPI_Final%20with%20logo2.pdf).\n- Changes in interpersonal interactions: Withdrawal from social activities, irritability[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-78340-6_6).\n- Physiological signs: Changes in heart rate, blood pressure, or sweating[2](https://www.verywellhealth.com/pain-assessment-1131968).\n- Protective behaviors: Guarding the painful area, limping, or favoring one side of the body[3](https://geriatricpain.org/sites/geriatricpain.org/files/2023-06/CNPI_Final%20with%20logo2.pdf).\n\nRemember, these behaviors can vary greatly among individuals and may be influenced by a variety of factors, including cultural background, personal beliefs about pain, and previous pain experiences. Therefore, understanding and interpreting these behaviors requires a comprehensive and individualized approach.\n\n## Examples\n\n- Pain adjustment movements\n- Cracking body parts (knuckle, neck)\n- Withdrawal\n- Excessive Sleep / Napping\n- Talking about illnesses\n- Complaining\n- \"I can't\" responses\n- Missing activities / school / absences\n- Tics\n- Spells\n- Grumbling / groaning\n- Attitude\n- Vomiting / Talking about nausea\n\n# Why do pain behaviors exist?\n\n- Feel better!\n- Get assistance\n- Reduce demands / expectations\n- Protect from additional injury / provide protection\n\n\u003e \\[!cross\\] Pain\n\u003e All pain is produced in the brain, and can produce it as much as it wants.

They are intended to help individuals learn from their actions and understand the impact of their choices. Consequences are not necessarily negative; they can be positive as well. They are directly related to the behavior and are reasonable and respectful. For example, if a child refuses to eat their dinner, a natural consequence might be that they feel hungry later.\n**Punishments**, on the other hand, are negative outcomes that are imposed in response to undesirable behavior. The primary goal of punishment is to deter or suppress the behavior. Punishments are often unrelated to the behavior and can be arbitrary or harsh. For example, if a child refuses to eat their dinner, a punishment might be that they are not allowed to watch TV for a week.\n\nIn summary, while both consequences and punishments are responses to behavior, consequences are learning opportunities that are directly related to the behavior, while punishments are negative impositions intended to suppress the behavior. It's important to note that the effectiveness of consequences and punishments can vary greatly depending on the context and the individual involved. Always consider the individual's needs, the situation, and the potential impacts when deciding between consequences and punishments.\n\n\u003e \\[!question\\] Are you happy?\n\u003e **You are only as happy as your most miserable child**\n\n# Warm Neutrality Applies to Many Areas\n\n- Fighting kid's battles in school\n- Emailing teachers asking for accommodations\n- Not following through on consequences\n- Any other action that potentially shows that the kid can't do things on their own\n\n# Feeling Better is *their* responsibility\n\n- No consequences for:\n  - Eating\n  - Going to bed on-time\n  - Breathing\n  - Taking care of Self\n- Consequences on results:\n  - Pain Behaviors\n  - Chores\n  - Punctuality\n  - Respect\n\n\u003e \\[!important\\] Follow Through\n\u003e It is essential to follow through on the consequences... it's just 24 hours, but then it will have the desired effect\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.627655511Z","tags":["PRC"]},"/Source/PRC-Parent-Group-Contacts":{"title":"PRC - Parent Group Contacts","content":"Andrea - acde09@gmail.com\nTrish - Trishk555@gmail.com\nLynette - Lynettedolan@hotmail.com\nDave - dave.dachs@gmail.com\nClay - William.clay.cochran@gmail.com\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.627655511Z","tags":[]},"/Source/PRC-Plans-for-going-home":{"title":"PRC - Plans for going home","content":"\n# Rules\n\n- Need to figure out which strategies apply to who in the house?\n- Chores should apply to all kids\n- Rules like napping should apply to all\n- Adults napping is OK, as long as it's kept away from the kids and no bragging\n- Figure out what to share and who to share it with, so limit or minimize questions about health.\n- Steve \u0026 Ksusha?

This process can lead to further side effects and unanticipated drug interactions, which may result in further symptoms and misdiagnoses[3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prescription_cascade).\n\nFor example, a patient might be prescribed a calcium channel blocker, which can cause ankle edema. If this side effect is misinterpreted as a new medical condition, a diuretic might be prescribed to treat the edema[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215). In another example, a patient develops a cough after starting an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor. A cough syrup with guafenasin and codeine is prescribed, leading to lethargy. Levofloxacin is started for presumed pneumonia, which leads to diarrhea, followed by delirium and admission to hospital[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215).\n\nPrescribing cascades contribute to inappropriate polypharmacy, particularly in older adults[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215). Patients with chronic conditions and geriatric syndromes that require complex drug regimens are at increased risk for problematic and inappropriate polypharmacy[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215).\n\nTo prevent prescribing cascades, healthcare providers should ask themselves if a patient's new symptom could be an adverse drug event from a medication they are already taking. If so, they should consider whether the initial drug could be substituted for a safer alternative or if the dose could be reduced, potentially eliminating the need for the subsequent drug therapy[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215). Deprescribing, or the process of tapering or stopping drugs that may not be indicated, can also be considered when a cascade is identified[2](https://www.cmaj.ca/content/193/6/E215).\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.627655511Z","tags":["PRC"]},"/Source/PRC-Relapse-Prevention":{"title":"PRC - Relapse Prevention","content":"\n# PRC is NOT\n\nNot about doing something once\n\n# PRC IS\n\nContinuing to do things even when not 100%\n\n# Key Concepts\n\n**New Mindset**\n\nAsking the question: **What can I do to manage this?**\n\nEspecially useful for new symptoms\n\n# Difficult Day vs Lapse vs Relapse\n\n- **Difficult Day** - High symptoms/stress but still using PRC concepts\n- **Lapse** - brief return to old habits in a moment of symptoms/stress, return to habits in one behavior\n- **Relapse** - prolonged return to old habits in many behaviors, decreased functioning, may need more intense intervention\n\n\u003e \\[!WARNING\\] Relapse\n\u003e Relapse is a process, not an event!\n\n# Potential triggers for lapse/relapse\n\n## Adolescent triggers and cues?\n\n- Friend drama\n- Family stressors\n- Reminder of something stressful\n- Acute Illness - New symptoms\n- Trips / Vacations\n- Summer - Less structure\n- Friends / Sleepovers\n- Rooms where pain was comforted (Bedroom, couch, etc.)\n  \\## Parent triggers and cues?\n- Flare / Increased or New Symptoms\n- Siblings\n- New Injury/Illness\n- New activities / sports\n- Busy\n- Not busy enough\n\n# CBT Triangle\n\nCan be used to help prevent relapse\n\\## Example - bad\n- Notice a lapse: \"I screwed up.

These rhythms affect many bodily processes, your mental state, and your behavior[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm). Perhaps the most well-known circadian rhythm is the sleep-wake cycle, which determines how sleepy or alert you feel throughout the day and night[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm).\n\nCircadian rhythms are controlled by biological clocks located in organs and glands throughout the body, but all of these peripheral clocks are commanded by a \"master clock\" in a region of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm). In most adults and adolescents, this master clock operates on a cycle that is slightly longer than 24 hours[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm).\n\nIn order to maintain alignment with the 24-hour rotation of the planet, the master clock must adjust by about 12 to 18 minutes every day[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm). For this reason, it times circadian rhythms according to environmental cues known as \"zeitgebers,\" German for \"timekeepers.\" Light and darkness are the most important and powerful zeitgebers[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm).\n\nCircadian rhythms help living things respond to changes in their environment in ways that conserve energy, help them find food, and allow them to grow and heal[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm). In humans, circadian rhythms serve many functions, including helping regulate:\n\n- Sleeping and waking\n- Core body temperature\n- The immune system\n- Hormones\n- Metabolism\n- Cognitive function\n- [The body's reaction to stress](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm)[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm)\n\nI've also created an image to help visualize the concept of Circadian Rhythms. Please check the visual section for the image. I hope this helps! If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.\n\n# Circadian Rhythms and AYAs\n\n- Most teens need 8.5-9.5 hours of sleep\n- Sleep Phase Delay is what happens when natural change to the rhythm happens\n- **Resetting circadian rhythms can be done through consistent sleep times**\n- When waking up, get active and let the light in to wake up\n\n# Two=process Model\n\nHomeostatic vs. Circadian\n\n**Homeostatic Process:** The term \"homeostasis\" describes a state of equilibrium between different elements of an organism. In the context of sleep, the homeostatic process, also known as \"sleep drive\" or \"sleep pressure,\" balances our need for sleep with our need for wakefulness[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock). When we've been awake for a long period of time, our sleep drive tells us that it's time to sleep. As we sleep, we regain homeostasis and our sleep drive diminishes[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock).\n\n**Circadian Process:** Our circadian rhythm is our body's natural 24-hour clock that regulates our sleep-wake cycle[2](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/circadian-rhythm). It affects many other systems throughout our body, including hormones, digestion, and body temperature[2](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/circadian-rhythm). This rhythm is influenced by environmental cues like sunlight[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock). On average, people feel most tired just after midnight and during the so-called afternoon slump that can occur after lunchtime[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock).\n\nIn summary, the homeostatic process keeps track of how long we have been awake and asleep, and the circadian process determines the optimal time for sleep[3](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000145). Both these processes work together to regulate our sleep patterns and overall alertness throughout the day[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock). If you disrupt either of these processes, it can lead to sleep disorders or other health issues[1](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/circadian-rhythm/sleep-drive-and-your-body-clock).\n\n# Sleep Cycles\n\n![Pasted image 20240523132804.png](PRC%20-%20Sleep%20and%20Chronic%20Symptoms-media/d132e8b1025dcfc6428b8d99f9c94aa7905a1824.png \"wikilink\")\n\\## REM\n- \"Rapid Eye Movement\"\n- Dream sleep\n- process emotional experiences\n- store memories\n- emotional recovery\n\\## Non-REM\n- State One-Transition\n- Stage Two\n- Stages Three \u0026 Four\n- Deep Delta sleep\n- Release of growth hormone\n- Physical recovery\n\n**Non-REM Sleep:** Non-REM sleep is characterized by less activity in the brain and occurs in three stages[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/sleep-stages.html)[2](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101):\n\n1.  **Stage 1:** This stage marks the transition from wakefulness to sleep and typically lasts less than 10 minutes. Your heartbeat, breathing, eye movements slow, and your muscles relax[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/sleep-stages.html).\n2.  **Stage 2:** This is a period of light sleep before you enter deeper sleep. It lasts roughly 20 minutes. Your heartbeat and breathing slow further, and your brain begins to produce bursts of rapid, rhythmic brain wave activity known as sleep spindles[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/sleep-stages.html).\n3.  **Stage 3 (N3):** This is the deepest period of sleep and lasts 20 to 40 minutes. Your heartbeat and breathing slow to their lowest levels, and your muscles are so relaxed that it may be hard to awaken you[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/sleep-stages.html).\n\nDuring the deep stages of NREM sleep, the body repairs and regrows tissues, builds bone and muscle, and strengthens the immune system[2](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101).\n\n**REM Sleep:** REM sleep is the most active part of your sleep cycle, characterized by rapid eye movement (REM) and brain activity[3](https://www.sleepdr.com/the-sleep-blog/rem-vs-non-rem-related-sleep-what-you-should-know/). Dreaming is often associated with REM sleep[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/sleep-stages.html)[2](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101). During REM sleep, your eyes move around rapidly in a range of directions, but don't send any visual information to your brain[2](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101). REM sleep occurs 90 minutes after sleep onset and is a much deeper sleep than any of the stages of non-REM sleep[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/sleep-stages.html).\n\nThe first period of REM typically lasts 10 minutes. Each of your later REM stages gets longer, and the final one may last up to an hour[2](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101). Your heart rate and breathing quicken during REM sleep[2](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101).\n\nThe sleep cycle starts with non-REM sleep, followed by a shorter period of REM sleep, and then the cycle starts over again[2](https://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/sleep-101). These cycles repeat every 90 to 110 minutes on average[1](https://www.simplypsychology.org/sleep-stages.html).\n\n# Non-restorative Sleep\n\nA person with fibromyalgia would get a lot less restful sleep\n\n\u003cfigure\u003e\n\u003cimg\nsrc=\"PRC%20-%20Sleep%20and%20Chronic%20Symptoms-media/510ab94e944f60ca5a4583231144c9a2de8f2996.png\"\ntitle=\"wikilink\" alt=\"Pastedimage20240523132937.png\" /\u003e\n\u003cfigcaption\naria-hidden=\"true\"\u003ePastedimage20240523132937.png\u003c/figcaption\u003e\n\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n# Sleep Stealers\n\n- Changing bedtime and wake schedules\n- Staying up past natural sleep time\n- Using caffeine or nicotine to stay awake\n- Taking naps\n- Working long shifts after school\n- Early morning or late night extracurricular activities\n\n# Other habits to consider...\n\n- Sleeping with music or television on\n- Exercise\n- Temperature, timing of the shower (warm shower 1-2 hours before bed OK)\n- Phones at bedside\n  -

The Hexaflex model is a hexagonally shaped visual aid used in ACT to classify and treat client problems holistically[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). It consists of six core processes that correspond to the core ACT principles[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/):\n1.  **Present Moment**: ACT is a present-moment-focused therapy. The purpose of this focus on the present moment is to restore a sense of control lost in many clients seeking therapy or coaching[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). ACT practitioners believe you cannot control anything except your behavior[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/)\n2.  **Acceptance**: Acceptance is taught as an alternative to experiential avoidance. Acceptance involves the active and aware embrace of those private events occasioned by one's history without unnecessary attempts to change their frequency or form[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).\n3.  **Values**: ACT allows therapists to include the client's values into the clinical or coaching work, ensuring that clients feel connected to and invested in the work[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/).\n\n4.  **Cognitive Defusion**: Cognitive defusion techniques attempt to alter the undesirable functions of thoughts and other private events, rather than trying to alter their form, frequency or situational sensitivity[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).\n\n5.  **Self-as-Context**: ACT promotes ongoing non-judgmental contact with psychological and environmental events as they occur[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).\n\n6.  **Committed Action**: ACT is all about helping clients cultivate psychological flexibility. The points of the hexaflex represent the six aspects of psychological flexibility[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). It is a person's ability to change their thinking and behavior when it is not serving them[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/).\n\nEach of these six domains corresponds to one of the core ACT principles, all of which have various activities and exercises to help the practitioner push their clients along[1](https://positivepsychology.com/act-model/). The goal of ACT is to increase psychological flexibility -- the ability to contact the present moment more fully as a conscious human being, and to change or persist in behavior when doing so serves valued ends[2](https://contextualscience.org/the_six_core_processes_of_act).\n\n# ACT Hexaflex\n\n![[images/the-hexaflex.png]]\n\n# The Happiness Trap: Evolution of the Human Mind\n\n{{\u003c youtube kv6HkipQcfA \u003e}}\n\n## ONE SENTENCE SUMMARY:\nThe human mind's evolution to prioritize safety and survival leads to modern psychological suffering patterns.\n\n## MAIN POINTS:\n\n1.  Caveman minds evolved to constantly watch for danger to ensure survival.\n2.  Modern minds inherited the default setting of prioritizing safety and avoiding harm.\n3.  The caveman mind triggers warnings about potential dangers to protect from harm.\n4.  Anxiety in modern times stems from the caveman mind's focus on predicting worst-case scenarios.\n5.  Replaying survival encounters was useful in the Stone Age but leads to dwelling in modern times.\n6.  Comparison to others was crucial for fitting in and surviving in the caveman era.\n7.  Modern life's constant comparison to a vast group intensifies fear of judgment and rejection.\n8.  Stone Age mentality of needing more for survival translates to modern greed and dissatisfaction.\n9.  The pace and complexity of modern life amplify Stone Age thought patterns.\n10. The mind's behavior is a result of evolution, aiming to keep individuals safe and prevent pain.\n\n## TAKEAWAYS:\n\n1.  Understand that the mind's focus on safety and survival can lead to psychological suffering.\n2.  Recognize that modern anxieties and comparisons stem from evolutionary traits for survival.\n3.  Be mindful of dwelling on past events unnecessarily, as it may not serve a useful purpose.\n4.  Acknowledge the impact of constant comparison in modern life on feelings of inadequacy.\n5.

Here's a simplified explanation:\n\n1.  **Pain Detection**: Our body is covered with pain receptors, also known as sensory cells. These cells are found in our muscles, internal organs, and skin[1](https://www.britannica.com/video/180168/pain-human-body). When a part of your body is injured, these special pain receptors release chemicals called neurotransmitters[2](https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/ouch-that-hurts-the-science-of-pain/).\n\n2.  **Signal Transmission**: These neurotransmitters send messages along nerves to the spinal cord[2](https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/ouch-that-hurts-the-science-of-pain/).\n\n3.  **Pain Perception**: The messages eventually reach the brain, which processes the information and makes us aware of the pain[2](https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/ouch-that-hurts-the-science-of-pain/). The brain then sends signals to these organs or muscles to take appropriate action[3](https://www.nm.org/conditions-and-care-areas/pain-management/patient-education-understanding-pain).\n\nPain can be classified into three types based on their causes[4](https://www.physiology.org/publications/news/the-physiologist-magazine/2022/march/the-physiology-of-pain):\n\n- **Nociceptive Pain**: Caused by tissue damage. Most acute pain is nociceptive.\n- **Neuropathic Pain**: Caused by nerve damage or dysfunction. This kind of pain often feels similar to burning, shooting, or stabbing.\n- **Inflammatory Pain**: Occurs when your immune system activates in response to injury or infection. It can also make you more sensitive to feelings of pain.\n\nPain is a normal sensory signal that something might be wrong and that you should do something about it[2](https://magazine.medlineplus.gov/article/ouch-that-hurts-the-science-of-pain/). It's a protective mechanism: acute pain warns us of harm and prevents us from damaging our bodies, or limits that damage[4](https://www.physiology.org/publications/news/the-physiologist-magazine/2022/march/the-physiology-of-pain).\n\n## Deeper mechanics of pain transmission\n\n1.  **Nociceptors**: The transmission of pain is linked to nociceptors, which are a specialized subset of sensory neurons that mediate pain and densely innervate peripheral tissues[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/4/3064). Various subsets of nociceptors are further divided according to the type of stimuli (mechanical, chemical, thermal, or noxious) they respond to[1](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/4/3064).\n\n2.  **Pain Mechanisms**: Determining the most plausible pain mechanism(s) is crucial during clinical assessments as this can serve as a guide to determine the most appropriate treatment(s) for a patient[2](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Pain_Mechanisms). Pain mechanisms can be classified as 'nociceptive', 'peripheral neuropathic', 'central', and 'nociplastic'[2](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Pain_Mechanisms).\n\n3.  **Gate Control Theory**: This theory explains how non-painful input can interfere with pain signals in the spinal cord, preventing them from reaching the brain[3](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gate_Control_Theory_of_Pain). If the gate is open, pain signals can pass through and will be sent to the brain to perceive the pain. If the gate is closed, pain signals will be restricted from travelling up to the brain, and the sensation of pain won't be perceived[3](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Gate_Control_Theory_of_Pain).\n\n4.  **Pain Perception**: Pain perception is multi-dimensional, where the dimensions are not independent, but rather interactive[2](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Pain_Mechanisms). The dimensions include sensory-discriminative, affective-motivational, and cognitive-evaluative components[2](https://www.physio-pedia.com/Pain_Mechanisms).\n\n5.  **Communication**: Nearly every aspect of pain management relies on communication: assessing pain and functional status, deciding on pain management goals, implementing treatment plans, and assessing the effectiveness of those plans[4](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/19/11/2154/4834174). The need for clear communication is especially important for noncancer pain[4](https://academic.oup.com/painmedicine/article/19/11/2154/4834174).\n\nUnderstanding these mechanisms can help us better manage pain and develop more effective treatments. It's also important to remember that pain is a subjective experience and can be influenced by many factors, including emotional and psychological states[5](https://extension.usu.edu/relationships/faq/why-is-it-so-hard-to-communicate-about-pain).\n\n# Chronic vs Acute pain\n\nAcute \\\u003c 3-6 months\nChronic \\\u003e3-6 months\n\\## Detailed analysis of chronic vs acute\nChronic pain is a complex condition that's often different from acute pain. Here's how the body perceives chronic pain:\n\n1.  **Pain Signals**: When an injury occurs, pain sensors light up, sending messages via an electrical signal to the brain[1](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/chronic-pain). However, in chronic pain, the brain continues to receive pain signals long after the original injury or onset of pain[1](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/basics/chronic-pain).\n\n2.  **Sensitization**: Many chronic pain conditions arise from a process called sensitization. In this process, the brain and other parts of the nervous system overreact to sensory signals, and those signals are perceived as pain[2](https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/opioids/chronic-pain-take-steps-to-regain-your-life/).\n\n3.  **Psychosocial Factors**: Chronic pain is not just a physical sensation. It's deeply influenced by our thoughts and emotions, which can amplify the pain experience[3](https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/living-well/the-dimensions-of-chronic-pain/). Negative thoughts and emotions can intensify the pain, while positive thoughts and emotions can help reduce it[3](https://mcpress.mayoclinic.org/living-well/the-dimensions-of-chronic-pain/).\n\n4.  **Chronic vs Acute Pain**: Unlike acute pain, which is a direct response to a specific injury and usually resolves once the cause is addressed, chronic pain persists beyond the initial injury and often requires a more comprehensive approach to treatment[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12051-acute-vs-chronic-pain)[5](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/acute-vs-chronic-pain). Chronic pain can continue even after the injury or illness that caused it has healed or gone away[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12051-acute-vs-chronic-pain).\n\n5.  **Effects on Life**: Chronic pain can have significant effects on our lives. It can lead to low mood, anxiety, depression, social isolation, and even financial worries[6](https://www.pathways.health/blog/chronic-pain-long-term-effects-on-the-brain-and-body-explained/). It can also result in tense muscles, limited mobility, lack of energy, and changes in appetite[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12051-acute-vs-chronic-pain).\n\n6.  **Treatment**: Treatment for chronic pain often focuses on retraining the brain's interpretation of pain signals[7](https://musclepain.org/acute-vs-chronic-pain-understanding-the-difference/). This can involve a combination of medication, physical therapy, psychological therapy, and lifestyle changes[4](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/12051-acute-vs-chronic-pain).\n\nRemember, chronic pain is a complex condition that requires a comprehensive approach to management.\n\n# Chronic Pain Conditions Spinal Cord Changes\n\nIn chronic pain conditions, the spinal cord undergoes several changes that can amplify the perception of pain. Here's how it happens:\n\n1.  **Nociceptive-Induced Changes**: Painful stimuli trigger afferent fibers in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord to release neuropeptides and neurotransmitters[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11916-010-0111-0). These events induce multiple inflammatory and neuropathic processes in the spinal cord dorsal horn[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11916-010-0111-0).\n\n2.  **Modification and Plasticity of Neural Circuits**: The release of neuropeptides and neurotransmitters triggers modification and plasticity of local neural circuits in the spinal cord[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11916-010-0111-0). This means that the neural pathways in the spinal cord can change and adapt over time, which can lead to an increased sensitivity to pain[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11916-010-0111-0).\n\n3.  **Central Sensitization**: Chronic pain can result from a process known as central sensitization[2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2018.00018/full). This involves an upregulation of ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, similar to that of long-term potentiation (LTP)[2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2018.00018/full). This process leads to hypersensitization within the dorsal horn of the spinal cord[2](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2018.00018/full).\n\n4.  **Changes in AMPAR Trafficking**: In the spinal cord, nociceptive-induced changes in AMPA receptor (AMPAR) trafficking determine the central sensitization of the dorsal horn[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19336950.2021.1885836). Changes in AMPAR subunit composition compromise the balance between synaptic excitation and inhibition, rendering interneurons hyperexcitable to afferent inputs, and promoting Ca2+ influx into the dorsal horn neurons, thereby amplifying neuronal hyperexcitability[3](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/19336950.2021.1885836).\n\nThese changes can lead to an increased number of pain receptors, or a heightened sensitivity of existing receptors, which can result in an increased perception of pain. It's important to note that these changes are complex and can vary greatly between individuals[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11916-010-0111-0).\n\n\u003e \\[!NOTE\\] Over-sensitized\n\u003e This is something that can be calmed with training\n\n# Acute vs. Chronic Pain Video\n\n[Understanding Pain in less than 5 minutes, and what to do about it! - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_3phB93rvI)\n[PRC - Understanding Pain in 5 minutes video](PRC - Understanding Pain in 5 minutes video \"wikilink\")\n\n# Acute Pain (New Pain)\n\n- Tissue damage\n- You know, or can see the cause or area of pain\n- Reliable signal of a problem\n- Pain = Harm\n\n# Chronic Pain (Old Pain)\n\n- Tissue damage has healed\n- May not be a visible injury or known source of pain\n- May be in excess of physical findings, injury/disease process\n- Pain intensity has increased or stayed the same over time\n- Pain is no longer a reliable signal\n- Hurt \\\u003c\\\u003e Harm\n  \\# Pain Neurobiology - Chronic\n  Sure, let's delve into the neurobiology of chronic pain:\n\n1.  **Nociceptors**: Nociceptors are sensory neurons that respond to potentially damaging stimuli by sending signals to the spinal cord and brain[1](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/jcm/jcm-12-04199/article_deploy/jcm-12-04199-v2.pdf?version=1687767834). These neurons play a key role in the perception of pain[1](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/jcm/jcm-12-04199/article_deploy/jcm-12-04199-v2.pdf?version=1687767834).\n2.  **Types of Chronic Pain**: Chronic pain can be categorized into nociceptive/inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jcp.20693). Nociceptive pain is caused by damage to body tissue and usually described as a sharp, aching, or throbbing pain[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jcp.20693). Neuropathic pain is caused by damage or diseases affecting the somatosensory nervous system[2](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jcp.20693).\n3.  **Pain Mechanisms**: Pain mechanisms can be classified as 'nociceptive', 'peripheral neuropathic', 'central', and 'nociplastic'[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/13/4199). Each of these mechanisms involves different biological and neurological processes[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/13/4199).\n4.  **Central Sensitization**: In chronic pain conditions, the nervous system goes into a state of high reactivity. This lowers the threshold for what causes pain and subsequently comes to maintain pain even after the initial injury might have healed[4](https://chiulab.med.harvard.edu/files/chiu/files/lagomarsino_et_al_2021_neurobiol_pain.pdf).\n5.  **Neurotransmitters and Pain**: The transmission of pain signals is mediated by various neurotransmitters in the nervous system. These neurotransmitters can modulate the pain signals, either amplifying or dampening the perception of pain[1](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/jcm/jcm-12-04199/article_deploy/jcm-12-04199-v2.pdf?version=1687767834).\n6.  **Role of the Brain**: The brain plays a crucial role in the perception of pain. It not only interprets the pain signals, but also regulates them via descending pathways from the brain to the spinal cord[1](https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/jcm/jcm-12-04199/article_deploy/jcm-12-04199-v2.pdf?version=1687767834).  \n7.  **Psychological Factors**: Chronic pain isn't just a physical sensation. It's deeply influenced by our thoughts, emotions, and even our learning history. For instance, people who are fearful of pain or who have higher levels of stress may experience more pain[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/13/4199).\n8.  **Pain Management**: Understanding the neurobiology of pain can help in its management. For instance, cognitive behavioral techniques can help modify the thought patterns that can alter the perception of pain[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/13/4199). Moreover, physical therapies and certain medications can help manage the symptoms of chronic pain[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/13/4199).\n\nRemember, chronic pain is a complex condition that's influenced by an array of factors. It's not just about the physical sensation, but also about how your brain interprets and manages that sensation[3](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/12/13/4199).\n\\# Response to pain\n\\## Acute Pain\n- Rest/Sleep\n- Avoid work, school, chores\n- Avoid social interaction\n- Medication/interventions\n- Comfort/support --\\\u003e Healing --\\\u003e Resume function\n\\## Chronic Pain\n- Rest/Sleep\n- Avoid work, school, chores\n- Avoid social interaction\n- Medication/interventions\n- Comfort/support --\\\u003e Deconditioning, focus on pain, poor sleep, side effects/hyperalgesia, increased stress/depression, reinforcement for pain\n\\# Effects of chronic pain/symptoms on youth\n\nResources from Mayo Clinic that discuss the effects of chronic pain on youth:\n\n1.  **Finding Solutions for Your Teen's Chronic Pain**: This is an excerpt from the Mayo Clinic Guide to Pain Relief by Wesley P.

Here's how it typically works:\n\n1.  **Pain**: A person experiences chronic pain, which could be due to an injury, illness, or sometimes for no identifiable reason[1](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4798-chronic-pain).\n2.  **Physical Reaction**: The body reacts to the pain, often leading to tense muscles and fatigue[2](https://www.lin.health/insights/what-is-chronic-pain-cycle). This physical reaction can exacerbate the pain.\n3.  **Emotional Reaction**: Chronic pain can lead to emotional responses such as stress, fear, anger, and frustration[2](https://www.lin.health/insights/what-is-chronic-pain-cycle). These emotions can further intensify the perception of pain.\n4.  **Depression**: Over time, the constant pain and emotional distress can lead to depression[2](https://www.lin.health/insights/what-is-chronic-pain-cycle). Depression can make it harder to cope with the pain, creating a vicious cycle.\n5.  **Interference with Daily Life**: Chronic pain can interfere with daily activities, such as working, having a social life, and taking care of oneself or others[1](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4798-chronic-pain). It can lead to sleep problems, which can make the pain worse. This response creates a cycle that's difficult to break[1](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4798-chronic-pain).\n6.  **Boom and Bust Cycle**: This is a common pattern seen in people with chronic pain, where they have 'good' and 'bad' days[3](https://bing.com/search?q=cycle+of+chronic+pain). On good days, they may overdo activities, leading to increased pain and the need to rest on the following days. This pattern can lead to a decrease in overall activity level and worsening of pain over time[3](https://bing.com/search?q=cycle+of+chronic+pain).\n7.  **Chronic Pain Syndrome**: Chronic pain syndromes develop in what we call a vicious cycle[4](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/chronic-pain-syndrome). A vicious cycle is the cycle of pain causing pain: chronic pain that causes secondary complications, which subsequently make the original chronic pain worse[4](https://www.instituteforchronicpain.org/understanding-chronic-pain/what-is-chronic-pain/chronic-pain-syndrome).\n\nBreaking this cycle often involves a comprehensive approach to pain management, including medication, physical therapy, psychological therapy, and lifestyle changes[5](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/articles/chronic-pain)[1](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4798-chronic-pain).\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.631655515Z","tags":["pain"]},"/concepts/Biopsychosocial-factors":{"title":"Biopsychosocial Factors","content":"\n\n![](images/biopsychosocial-factors.png)\n\nThis concept refers to the interconnection between biology, psychology, and socio-environmental factors. These factors play a significant role in understanding health and wellness[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). Here's a breakdown of each component:\n\n1.  **Biological Factors**: These include physiological factors such as genetics and illness pathology[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). Our physical well-being impacts our mental health for multiple reasons. For example, chronic pain can lead to symptoms of depression[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226).\n\n2.  **Psychological Factors**: This involves thoughts, emotions, and behavior[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). Mental health is health, and one's psychological well-being impacts both mental and physical health[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226).\n\n3.  **Social Factors**: These encompass socioeconomic components, social support, and culture[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). Social factors can significantly influence both our physical and mental health[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226).\n\nThe biopsychosocial model, which incorporates these factors, was developed by Dr. George Engel and Dr. John Romano in the 1970s[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226). This model is now widely used in healthcare and has become an alternative to the biomedical and/or psychological dominance of many health care systems[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model). It provides a more holistic understanding of a patient's health by considering the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors[1](https://www.verywellmind.com/understanding-the-biopsychosocial-model-7549226)[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biopsychosocial_model).\n","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.631655515Z","tags":["social","biological","psychological"]},"/conduct/":{"title":"_index","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.631655515Z","tags":[]},"/long-term/":{"title":"_index","content":"","lastmodified":"2024-06-03T20:31:27.643655526Z","tags":[]}}
